For example, if multiple vehicles\ncapture images of the same car, they need only send semantic\nfeatures (like an ID or key descriptors) rather than the\nfull raw images. This semantic-aware approach promises to\ndrastically cut down the transmitted data, alleviating IoV\nspectrum bottlenecks and congestion. To implement this\nvision, the paper proposes a Cooperative Semantic Com-\nmunication (Co-SC) framework for multi-vehicle IoV . The\ncore idea is that multiple nearby vehicles jointly encode\ntheir sensed data into shared semantic information. The\narchitecture involves the following key components:\n\u2022Semantic encoders (at vehicles): Each vehicle (user) pro-\ncesses its raw data through a semantic encoder, which\nextracts a high-dimensional semantic feature that captures\nthe task-relevant meaning of the data (e.g. object identity,\nscene description).\n\u2022Joint Source-Channel (JSC) encoders (at vehicles): The\nsemantic features are then passed through a deep JSC\nencoder that maps them into channel symbols. Unlike\nconventional channel coding, this JSC encoding is se-\nmantically aware. Additionally, it learns to protect more\nimportant features by allocating more symbols, and it is\ntrained jointly with the semantic encoder.\n\u2022Shared channel transmission: Vehicles share a common\nwireless channel (e.g., uplink to a roadside server) to\nsend their semantic symbols. Since the semantic encoder\nhas removed overlap, the data from different cars is more\ncompact.\n\u2022Cooperative JSC decoder (at server): At the server or\nedge host, a cooperative JSC decoder jointly processes the\nreceived symbols from all vehicles. Because the vehicles\u2019\ndata is correlated, this decoder can use one user\u2019s symbols\nto help decode another\u2019s, narrowing the uncertainty space\nand correcting errors.\n\u2022Semantic decoder and task modules (at server): The\nrecovered semantic features are then fed into a semantic\ndecoder or directly into task-specific modules. In the\npaper\u2019s example (an image-based ID retrieval task), the\nserver uses the combined semantic features to identify\nvehicles in a database. The framework can also simply\nfeed semantic features to deep learning models for tasks\nlike detection or localization.\nThe proposed framework, Co-SC, is a novel multiuser coop-\nerative architecture. It integrates semantic encoders/decoders\nand joint source-channel coding for each vehicle, plus a\nshared knowledge base, so that multiple vehicles\u2019 data is\ncompressed and decoded jointly. By jointly designing the\nsemantic encoders and decoders across users, the system\nlearns shared representations: shared (common) semantics\nand distinct (unique) semantics are separated. The coopera-\ntive decoders exploit these correlations to compress redun-\ndancies and improve decoding.\nEldeeb et al. [106] developed a multi-task semantic\ncommunication framework among connected autonomousvehicles (CA Vs). They focus on sharing traffic sign informa-\ntion: one vehicle\u2019s camera captures a sign, a convolutional\nautoencoder extracts its semantic features, and the compact\nencoding is sent to other CA Vs over a network. At the\nreceiver, one decoder reconstructs the image (for visualiza-\ntion) and another classifies the sign. In simulations (e.g.,\nin foggy conditions), this task-oriented scheme outperforms\nconventional approaches in terms of classification accuracy\nand image similarity while using fewer bits. In other words,\nCA Vs share only goal-relevant semantic data (the label of\nthe sign), enhancing bandwidth efficiency without sacrificing\nsafety-critical understanding.\nThe multiuser cooperative designs [105], [106] highlight\nhow cooperation in MASs is key. Enabling cooperative,\nsemantic-rich transmissions could transform IoV from clas-\nsic bit-pipes into smart, goal-oriented networks for next-\ngeneration transportation.\nB. Distributed SLAM with goal-oriented communication\nDistributed Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM) is fundamental to the deployment of multi-robot\nsystems in real-world environments. However, traditional\nmulti-robot SLAM architectures face significant challenges\nrelated to communication bandwidth and computation costs.\nIn many systems, robots either exchange large, detailed sen-\nsor data, like full 3D point clouds or complete maps, at high\nfrequencies, which is costly and redundant, or avoid sharing\naltogether, leading to degraded localization and inconsistent\nmaps [107].\nOne promising approach in distributed SLAM is to reduce\nthe size and frequency of the data that robots share, by\ntransmitting only the most useful and compact information.\nThat is, robots can share compressed and relevant summaries\nof what they observe. These summaries are often called\nlightweight feature descriptors , and they capture the most\nrelevant geometric or semantic features of the environment,\nsuch as corners, edges, or recognizable objects. For example,\nthe DCL-SLAM framework [108] uses specialized descrip-\ntors built from LiDAR data that allow each robot to detect\nwhether it has visited a place before\u2014or whether another\nrobot has\u2014without needing to share the full scan. This saves\nsignificant bandwidth while still supporting accurate local-\nization and map merging. Another efficient method involves\ndividing a robot\u2019s map into smaller, more manageable pieces\ncalled 2.5D submaps. These represent the local environment\nusing height information, like a terrain map. Robots can align\nand compare these submaps with those from their teammates\nto determine how their positions relate. When a match is\nfound (called a loop closure), the robots can update their\nmaps accordingly. These updates are often performed using\na sliding window approach, meaning the robot focuses on\nrecent or relevant data only, which reduces computational\ncost while keeping the map consistent [109]. Studies have\nshown that this selective communication strategy can reduce\ndata exchange volume by approximately 30% while still\nVOLUME , 23\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nmaintaining global map consistency and accurate localiza-\ntion [109].\nAnother line of work focuses on robust loop closure de-\ntection and prioritization. For example, DOOR-SLAM [110]\nintroduces distributed pairwise consistency maximization to\nallow less conservative place-recognition thresholds, yielding\nmore valid inter-robot matches without exchanging raw\ndata. Using less stringent front-end thresholds while filtering\noutliers downstream improves both map accuracy and loop\nclosure yield under constrained bandwidths. In [111], key\nmatches are selected based on pose graph structure, proxim-\nity, and point-cloud features for loop closure prioritization\nfor large-scale multi-robot exploration, reducing computa-\ntional load by roughly 50\u201375% while improving mapping\naccuracy.\nOne prominent system demonstrating this approach is\nKimera-Multi [112], a fully distributed SLAM framework\nthat allows multiple robots to collaboratively build both ge-\nometric and semantic maps. Kimera-Multi operates through\npeer-to-peer communication, meaning robots connect di-\nrectly without relying on a central server. It integrates robust\nplace recognition andpose-graph optimization , which aligns\nthe relative positions of robots and observed landmarks.\nThese capabilities enable the system to build globally con-\nsistent, annotated 3D mesh maps in real-time while keeping\ncommunication minimal. The result is an efficient and scal-\nable system that supports real-world deployment scenarios,\nsuch as exploration, search and rescue, and infrastructure\ninspection, even under tight bandwidth constraints.\nCollaborative SLAM has been effectively adapted for use\nin teams of UA Vs, allowing them to map and navigate large\nenvironments together [113]\u2013[115]. One practical approach\ninvolves equipping each UA V with a monocular camera\nand short-range wireless ranging devices. When two UA Vs\ncome close to one another, they can combine their views to\nform a temporary stereo vision setup. This setup allows the\nteam to better estimate distances and improve the accuracy\nof the map, especially in challenging environments where\nscale is hard to determine from a single camera alone.\nImportantly, this collaboration is done in a distributed way,\nin which each UA V processes its own data locally and\nonly shares essential information with its neighboring UA Vs.\nThis keeps communication fast and efficient, with minimal\ndelay, making the system well-suited for real-time tasks like\nexploration, inspection, or search and rescue. By working\ntogether in this manner, UA Vs can build more accurate\nand consistent maps while avoiding the need to send large\namounts of raw sensor data over the network.\nOverall, these innovations represent a shift toward more\ngoal-oriented communication in multi-robot mapping. These\nstrategies help robots collaborate in real-time while im-\nprove both efficiency and robustness in dynamic, bandwidth-\nlimited environments. By sharing only what\u2019s needed, when\nit\u2019s needed, they embody the principles of goal-oriented\ncommunication in SLAM. Experimental benchmarks acrossdiverse environments (e.g. subterranean, outdoor exploration,\nGPS-denied settings) consistently show that such task-driven\nschemes outperform dense or static communication ap-\nproaches in both map accuracy and bandwidth efficiency.\nLooking forward, embedding explicit goal-awareness into\nSLAM communication policies will be critical, including\nlearning to predict when a loop closure will significantly\nreduce global uncertainty, compressing semantics (e.g., ob-\nject landmarks, semantic segmentation maps) rather than raw\ngeometry, and designing adaptive coordination strategies that\nbalance exploration versus sharing, especially in heteroge-\nneous agent teams or dynamic environments. Such directions\nalign with the broader vision of goal-driven communication:\nagents communicate not just to share data, but to support\nshared objectives with minimal cost.\nC. Federated Learning and Edge Intelligence\nAnother important domain where goal-oriented communi-\ncation can be a key enabler are AI/ML services, relying on\nfederated learning (FL) and edge intelligence. Here, resource\nand communication efficiency are pivotal and unfortunately,\ntraditional paradigms usually rely on message exchanges\nthat do not consider if the transmitted data effectively\ncontributes to the global learning goal. As a remedy, goal-\noriented communication can address redundant transmis-\nsions by activating devices only when their information\nadvances the global learning objective. Considering that edge\nenvironments are characterized by heterogeneous resource\navailability and dynamic network conditions, the benefits of\ngoal-oriented communication have been presented in various\nrecent works.\nThe paper by Pandey et al. [116] introduces a risk-aware\nparticipation strategy for FL, treating device selection as a\ndistributed goal-oriented communication problem. In greater\ndetail, devices independently evaluate whether participating\nin a particular training round will benefit the global model\nwhile considering their local costs and the value of their\ncontributions. To support this process, a parameter server is\nused, providing semantic feedback to each device, facilitating\nthem to calculate the utility of its update and in case\nthe marginal benefit is insufficient it will remain silent.\nThis process results in significant reduction of unnecessary\ntransmissions, while avoiding the propagation of low-quality\nupdates. Performance evaluation demonstrates that integrat-\ning risk-awareness and semantic feedback into the partic-\nipation decisions, a 1.4\u00d7improvement in communication\nefficiency over baseline FL alternatives is achieved, without\ndegrading model accuracy. A relevant use case for this\nstrategy can be smart healthcare systems, where mobile and\nwearable devices must optimize power usage, data privacy,\nand relevance to the global model before contributing to\ncollaborative diagnostics.\nThen, Costafreda and Elayoubi [117] proposes a hybrid\noptimization approach, adopting goal-oriented communica-\ntion in the scheduling and resource allocation of FL in\n24 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 25 ---\nGoal-oriented\ncommunication edge intelligenceFIGURE 4. A unified scenario illustrating goal-oriented communication in MASs: autonomous ground vehicles, cyclists, and aerial drones\ncollaboratively operate in a smart city environment. Agents share semantically relevant, goal-oriented information for coordinated navigation,\nsurveillance, and human interaction, demonstrating key application domains such as distributed perception, edge intelligence, and safety-critical\ncoordination under bandwidth constraints.\nmobile networks. More specifically, the authors formulate\na policy selection problem to optimize the device sampling\nprobabilities to balance resource usage and data utility, in\nterms of the processing capacity of each device and the qual-\nity of its data. In this setting, a hybrid genetic algorithm is\npresented, dynamically adapting the transmission strategies\nto prioritize clients whose updates maximize model accuracy\nunder radio resource constraints. Contrary to traditional FL,\nwhere all available clients might contribute equally, this hy-\nbrid approach ensures that only clients with high data utility\nand low transmission cost will participate. This strategy leads\nto a communication-efficient FL process, achieving higher\nperformance with a reduced number of updates. A relevant\narea where this method can be employed involves vehicular\nnetworks, where edge devices in cars must appropriately\nschedule their participation in federated perception models,\nadhering to strict latency and bandwidth constraints.\nFurthermore, Wei et al. in [118] develop a novel federated\nsemantic learning (FedSem) architecture, considering the IB\nprinciple into a multi-user semantic communication setting\nfor FL. Their system focuses on transmitting compressed\nbut semantically rich representations to construct semantic\nknowledge graphs from raw images, allowing for efficient\nand task-specific learning. Here, instead of treating all se-\nmantic features equally, the information bottleneck principle\nfilters out non-essential content, only keeping task-relevant\nsemantics for the inference objective. The proposed feder-\nated training process jointly updates device-side semantic\nencoders and a base station-side decoder. Results indicateimportant gains in rate-distortion efficiency and faster con-\nvergence under dynamic channel conditions. Architectures,\nsuch as FedSem can be well-suited to applications related\nto collaborative aerial surveillance with drones, where only\nmission-critical semantic features, such as detected threats\nor anomalies must be communicated to improve resource\nefficiency of the learning task.\nThen, Wei et al. [119] focuses on combining goal-oriented\ncommunication with FL, developing a resource allocation\nframework tailored to CPS. Their solutions departs from\nconventional throughput-maximization, maximizing instead\nthe information utility gain, i.e. the marginal improvement in\nCPS task objectives stemming from data transmission. Thus,\nthey model FL as a CPS task, where devices are selectively\nprovided communication resources, based on how their data\ncontributes to system-level goals. The resource allocation\nproblem is formulated as a knapsack problem and solved via\na divide-and-conquer greedy algorithm. Simulations high-\nlight that optimizing for task-related information over data\nthroughput offers high efficiency gains in FL performance.\nThis approach can be applied to IIoT deployments, such\nas predictive maintenance in manufacturing plants, where\nsensors must prioritize energy-efficient transmissions that\nimprove the accuracy fault prediction models.\nBelow we discuss two works that consider semantics-\naware metrics in FL. More specifically, the work in [120]\nproposes a scheduling policy that combines Age of Update\n(AoU) concepts and the data Shapley metric. This policy\nconsiders the freshness and value of received parameter\nVOLUME , 25\n\n--- Page 26 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nupdates from individual data sources and real-time channel\nconditions to enhance the operational efficiency of FL.\nFurthermore, the work in [121] introduces the concept of\nVersion Age of Information (V AoI) to FL. Unlike traditional\nAoI metrics, V AoI considers both timeliness and content\nstaleness. Each client\u2019s version age is updated discretely,\nindicating the freshness of information. V AoI is incorporated\ninto the client scheduling policy to minimize the average\nV AoI, mitigating the impact of outdated local updates and\nenhancing the stability of FL systems.\nVII. Open Challenges and Future Directions\nA. Unifying Information-Theoretic and Learning-Based\nApproaches\nA key open challenge in goal-oriented communication for\nMASs lies in bridging the gap between information-theoretic\nformulations andlearning-based communication strategies .\nClassical information theory provides a rigorous framework\nfor quantifying data relevance and efficiency using tools such\nas mutual information, rate-distortion theory, and channel\ncapacity [22], [23]. More recent extensions, including goal-\noriented rate-distortion [52], [53], [122] and semantic com-\nmunication models [48] aim to describe information sources\nthat have semantic aspects and proposed corresponding\nrate distortion problem formulations for characterizing the\namount of information content of such semantic sources.\nHowever, these methods often assume known models and\ndistributions, which are rarely available in large-scale, real-\nworld MASs. In contrast, learning-based approaches, es-\npecially those rooted in DRL and MARL, offer flexible\nmechanisms for discovering communication policies through\nlearning. Agents can learn to determine what, when, and with\nwhom to communicate by optimizing task-level objectives\ndirectly, often using attention mechanisms or graph-based\nmessage passing (see relevant discussion is Section B).\nDespite notable advancements, a gap remains between\ninformation-theoretic and learning-based approaches to com-\nmunication. Learning methods provide flexible, data-driven\nmechanisms for discovering effective communication strate-\ngies, yet they often offer no formal guarantees of optimality.\nIn contrast, information-theoretic models yield frameworks\nfor quantifying relevance and efficiency, but they typically\nrely on idealized assumptions and do not readily adapt to\ncomplex task-driven settings. Bridging this gap calls for\nthe development of hybrid approaches that embed theo-\nretical structure into learning-based models. For example,\none strategy is to incorporate information relevance (formu-\nlated through rate-distortion or utility-based criteria) into the\nlearning objectives of communication systems. By treating\ncommunication as a constrained optimization problem over\nboth message content and utility, it becomes possible to\ndesign learning systems that are not only effective but\nalso grounded in formal principles of informational value.\nUltimately, the overarching objective is to design learning-\nbased communication systems that are not only empiricallyeffective but also theoretically grounded. These systems\nshould be capable of learning what to communicate, when,\nand to whom according to a goal (individual or joint).\nAchieving this vision necessitates a deeper integration of\ninformation significance metrics with modern machine learn-\ning paradigms.\nAdditionally, learning-to-communicate frameworks will\nneed to be extended to support compositional reasoning,\nsemantic abstraction, and causal inference to ensure gener-\nalization and interpretability (see discussion in Section C).\nAs multi-agent deployments become increasingly prevalent\nin real-world domains, ranging from autonomous vehicles\nto environmental monitoring and disaster response, learning-\nbased goal-oriented communication will be a key enabler of\nefficient, scalable, and intelligent collective behavior.\nB. Scalability in Large Multi-Agent Systems\nAs the number of agents in a MAS increases, commu-\nnication, coordination, and learning become significantly\nmore complex. Scalability is a critical challenge for goal-\noriented communication, particularly in systems involving\ndense, heterogeneous, or spatially distributed agents. In\nsuch settings, naive communication strategies, such as all-\nto-all broadcasting or uniform message passing, become\nimpractical due to excessive bandwidth usage, latency, and\nprocessing overhead.\nTo enable efficient coordination at scale, communica-\ntion must become increasingly selective, structured, and\ndecentralized. One promising direction involves exploiting\ntopological sparsity through graph-based message passing\nframeworks, where agents only communicate with a sub-\nset of their neighbors based on learned attention weights,\nproximity, or role-based criteria. These approaches allow\nfor adaptive communication graphs that evolve in response\nto task demands and environmental dynamics, significantly\nreducing communication overhead without sacrificing perfor-\nmance. Another key aspect of scalability is the emergence\nofhierarchical architectures , where agents are organized\ninto clusters or roles (e.g., leaders, followers, relays), and\nintra-cluster and inter-cluster communication are treated\ndifferently. This enables localized decision-making while\nmaintaining global coordination, and aligns naturally with\ngoal-oriented communication models. In addition, multi-\nresolution orcompressed representation learning approaches\noffer further scalability benefits by enabling agents to ex-\nchange task-specific features rather than raw state observa-\ntions. Such techniques are particularly useful when combined\nwith importance-aware scheduling, where agents selectively\ntransmit only high-value information according to metrics\nsuch as CoIL, V oI or AoI (see discussion in Section IV).\nAchieving scalable goal-oriented communication requires\nthe joint design of communication protocols, learning algo-\nrithms, and network architectures. This includes developing\nsparsity-aware learning objectives, integrating hierarchical\ncoordination schemes, and leveraging the structure of real-\n26 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nworld environments to reduce the effective communication\ncomplexity. As the size and diversity of MASs continue to\ngrow, the ability to scale communication in a goal-relevant\nmanner will be essential for enabling efficient, robust, and\ninterpretable collective intelligence.\nC. Safety, Reliability, and Interpretability of Emergent\nProtocols\nAs communication protocols in multi-agent systems be-\ncome increasingly learned and emergent, questions of safety,\nreliability, and interpretability take on critical importance.\nWhile learning-based communication policies enable adap-\ntivity and task-awareness, they also introduce unpredictabil-\nity and potential fragility, especially in safety-critical appli-\ncations such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, or\ncollaborative robotics. In such contexts, agents must ensure\nthat their messaging strategies do not inadvertently degrade\nsystem safety or violate task constraints. For example, de-\ncisions about whether or not to transmit information can\ndirectly impact state estimation, control performance, and\nultimately, system stability. This calls for communication\nprotocols that are not only goal-oriented but also robust\nto uncertainties, resilient to adversarial perturbations, and\ntransparent in their behavior.\nA particularly important concern in safety-critical con-\ntrol is the guarantee of set invariance , i.e., ensuring that\nthe system\u2019s state remains within a predefined safe set\nover time. Various safety filters , such as those based on\ncontrol barrier functions or predictive filtering, have been\ndeveloped to detect and correct unsafe control inputs in a\nminimally invasive manner. However, these typically require\nsafety constraints to be explicitly defined in the state space,\nwhich limits their applicability to geometrically grounded\nconditions like collision avoidance. For agents operating\nin complex or human-centric environments, safety often\nextends beyond geometric constraints to encompass seman-\ntic, context-dependent rules, referred to as semantic safety\nconstraints [123]. Designing communication and control\nprotocols that respect such implicit constraints remains an\nopen challenge. It requires integrating high-level knowledge,\nreasoning, and shared intent into the communication loop.\nIn parallel, the interpretability of emergent protocols is\nessential for system verification, human\u2013robot collaboration,\nand transferability across tasks and domains. Understanding\nwhat information is communicated, why it is shared, and\nhow it affects collective decision-making is crucial for es-\ntablishing trust in autonomous multi-agent systems.\nUltimately, ensuring that learned communication policies\nremain safe, reliable, and interpretable requires combining\ndesign with adaptive learning. It calls for the develop-\nment of formal tools to analyze and constrain emergent\nbehaviors, along with empirical validation in realistic, high-\nstakes scenarios. As goal-oriented communication continues\nto evolve, these properties will be key enablers of real-world\ndeployment.D. Extensions of GIB\nGIB offers a foundation for designing communication\nprotocols in MASs. We discuss some promising possible\nresearch directions that can significantly expand the applica-\nbility and impact of GIB-based methods.\nFirst, extending GIB to temporal domains is a crucial\nstep toward supporting agents that operate in dynamic,\nsequential environments. Many MAS tasks, such as cooper-\native exploration, real-time traffic coordination, or adaptive\nmonitoring, demand communication protocols that take into\naccount the history of observations and interactions over\ntime. A temporal extension of GIB would allow agents to\nencode and transmit compressed yet informative summaries\nof their trajectories, decisions, and evolving internal states.\nThese models could be implemented via recurrent GNNs,\ngraph-attention mechanisms, or temporal message-passing\nframeworks, capturing dependencies not only across space\n(agents) but also across time. Furthermore, temporal GIB\ncould help mitigate memory bottlenecks and redundancy by\nfiltering out outdated or irrelevant historical data, focusing\ninstead on predictive and decision-critical features.\nSecond, the development of hierarchical GIB architectures\nholds promise for improving scalability and modularity in\nlarge-scale MASs. In many practical settings, agents are\nnaturally organized into subgroups, either by spatial prox-\nimity, function, or communication constraints. Hierarchical\nGIB models can support multi-level abstraction, where bot-\ntlenecks are enforced not only at the individual agent level\nbut also across clusters, regions, or roles. For example,\nintra-group communication could involve fine-grained, high-\nfrequency updates, while inter-group communication could\nbe based on coarse, abstract representations. This separation\nof concerns allows the system to scale gracefully and remain\nrobust under variable communication budgets or partial\nagent failure. Additionally, hierarchical models align well\nwith concepts in hierarchical reinforcement learning and\ndecentralized planning, enabling structured communication\nthat mirrors task hierarchies.\nThird, integrating GIB with tools from causal inference\ncan improve the interpretability, generalization, and relia-\nbility of learned communication policies. Traditional infor-\nmation bottleneck methods rely on statistical dependencies,\nwhich may not always correspond to causal influences on\ntask outcomes. By incorporating causal reasoning into the\nbottleneck objective, GIB can help agents to generalize\nacross different environments and task configurations, im-\nprove robustness to distribution shifts, and facilitate debug-\nging and verification of communication strategies.\nTogether, these extensions point toward a unified vision of\nGIB as a flexible and theoretically grounded framework for\ngoal-oriented, scalable, and interpretable communication in\ncomplex multi-agent environments. By integrating temporal\nmodeling, hierarchical structure, and causal reasoning, future\nGIB models can better accommodate the rich demands of\nreal-world MASs applications.\nVOLUME , 27\n\n--- Page 28 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nE. Cross-Domain Synergies\nWhile this overview has concentrated on goal-oriented\ncommunication within MASs, the concepts discussed here\nresonate strongly with several adjacent research areas. These\ndomains not only present new application frontiers but\nalso introduce complementary tools and challenges that can\nrefine and extend goal-oriented communication paradigms.\nIn particular, three cross-domain interfaces stand out as both\npromising and underexplored.\nFirst, multi-modal perception [124] integrates heteroge-\nneous sensory streams (namely, vision, language, audio,\ntactile feedback) into unified representations that capture\nricher context than any single modality alone. Embedding\ngoal-oriented communication within multi-modal pipelines\nenables agents to transmit distilled, semantically aligned\nsummaries rather than raw sensor data, thereby reducing\nbandwidth and processing requirements without sacrificing\ntask-critical content. For example, instead of streaming entire\nvideo frames, an autonomous vehicle could share compact\nsymbolic descriptors of relevant objects and their predicted\ntrajectories. The central challenge lies in developing multi-\nmodal semantic encoders and decoders whose distortion\nmeasures are explicitly tied to downstream task success,\nrather than modality-specific reconstruction fidelity.\nSecond, large-scale distributed AI [125], including fed-\nerated learning, distributed optimization, and cooperative\ninference, pushes communication constraints to the fore-\nfront. In such systems, agents often operate under stringent\nbandwidth, latency, and privacy requirements while jointly\noptimizing a shared model or decision policy. Integrat-\ning goal-oriented principles into federated decision-making\ncould allow agents to exchange only those gradients, feature\nembeddings, or variables that provide maximal utility for\nglobal performance. This opens new research challenges:\nquantifying the value of such updates via information-\ntheoretic or causal measures, designing adaptive commu-\nnication topologies that dynamically select optimal peer\ninteractions, and ensuring robustness under adversarial or\nnon-stationary conditions.\nThird, causal inference [126] offers a foundation for\ninterpretability and robustness in goal-oriented messaging.\nBy augmenting transmitted content with causal structure\n(e.g., explanations of why a message is relevant or how\nan observation affects task outcomes) agents can improve\ncoordination, detect misleading updates, and anticipate the\nimpact of actions in safety-critical settings. This is especially\nvaluable for human\u2013machine teaming, where trust hinges\non transparency and accountability. Open research directions\ninclude formalizing causal semantics within rate\u2013distortion\nand information bottleneck frameworks, incorporating them\ninto real-time communication protocols, and exploring how\ncausal annotations can enhance resilience to distribution\nshifts or deceptive behavior.\nBridging goal-oriented communication with these do-\nmains will require new theoretical models, joint learn-ing\u2013communication optimization strategies, and cross-\ndomain interfaces. Achieving this integration promises a\nnew class of cyber\u2013physical and AI systems capable of\nexchanging only the most task-relevant, interpretable, and\nsemantically rich information across sensing, computation,\nand control layers, thus minimizing overhead while maxi-\nmizing effectiveness, transparency, and safety.\nVIII. Concluding remarks\nGoal-oriented communication is emerging as a foundational\nparadigm in the design of intelligent and efficient multi-\nagent systems. By shifting the focus from transmitting data\nfor the sake of fidelity to communicating information that\nisrelevant for achieving shared objectives , this paradigm\nprovides a way to reduce bandwidth, improve coordina-\ntion, and enhance task performance in resource-constrained\nenvironments. This overview has outlined the theoretical\nframeworks, mentioning some real-world applications of\ngoal-oriented communications, offering a unified lens that\nbridges information theory and learning-based strategies in\nthe context of MASs. We have highlighted how classical\nmodels such as rate-distortion theory and mutual informa-\ntion serve as building blocks for more advanced constructs\nlike goal-oriented and SDR frameworks. These approaches\nprovide formal metrics to quantify the utility of infor-\nmation with respect to tasks, offering critical insights for\ncommunication scheduling and prioritization in multi-agent\nsettings. At the same time, learning-based techniques have\ndemonstrated the potential to discover efficient, decentralized\ncommunication policies directly from data. As multi-agent\nsystems grow in scale, complexity, and heterogeneity, the\nimportance of designing communication protocols that are\ntask-aware, adaptive, and scalable will continue to grow.\nWe have discussed the key strategies to meet these needs and\nemphasized the critical importance of safety, reliability, and\ninterpretability in learned communication protocols, espe-\ncially for real-world deployment in high-stakes domains such\nas autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial automation.\nDespite significant progress, numerous open challenges re-\nmain. The integration of information-theoretic structure into\nneural architectures, the design of benchmarks for evaluating\ngoal-oriented communication systems, and the development\nof robust methods for reasoning under semantic and temporal\nuncertainty are all fertile grounds for future research. There\nis also a pressing need for tools that can formally analyze and\nconstrain the behavior of emergent communication protocols\nto ensure safe and predictable operation.\nThe vision outlined in this paper is one where communi-\ncation in MASs becomes a purposeful, context-aware act,\ndriven not by the quantity of data, but by its value to\na collective goal. This overview can serve as a roadmap\nfor researchers and practitioners seeking to build the next\ngeneration of communication-aware multi-agent systems that\nare not only efficient, but also intelligent, robust, and aligned\nwith their operational objectives.\n28 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 29 ---\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

Traditional communication paradigms often emphasize message fidelity or bandwidth\noptimization, overlooking the task relevance of the exchanged information. In contrast, goal-oriented\ncommunication prioritizes the importance of information with respect to the agents\u2019 shared objectives. This\nreview provides a comprehensive survey of goal-oriented communication in MAS, bridging perspectives\nfrom information theory, communication theory, and machine learning. We examine foundational concepts\nalongside learning-based approaches and emergent protocols. Special attention is given to coordination\nunder communication constraints, as well as applications in domains such as swarm robotics, federated\nlearning, and edge computing. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future research\ndirections at the intersection of communication theory, machine learning, and multi-agent decision making.\nINDEX TERMS Goal-oriented communication, multi-agent systems, communication efficiency, coordina-\ntion under constraints.\nI. Introduction\nIN RECENT YEARS, there has been a growing interest\ntoward employing networks of autonomous agents to\nsolve complex tasks collaboratively. These systems, known\nas multi-agent systems (MASs), achieve global objectives\nthrough localized interactions and decentralized decision-\nmaking among individual agents [1]\u2013[3]. Modern MASs\nare increasingly deployed in dynamic, distributed, and\ncommunication-constrained environments. Applications such\nas autonomous vehicle coordination [4]\u2013[6], distributed sens-\ning and estimation [7]\u2013[9], and swarm robotics [10]\u2013[13]\ndemand not only local intelligence but also effective com-\nmunication among agents.Communication plays a critical role in enabling coordina-\ntion and information sharing across agents, particularly when\nlocal observations are limited or partial. However, several\nfundamental challenges hinder effective communication in\nMASs. The major challenges are listed below.\n\u2022Bandwidth limitations restrict how much information can\nbe exchanged in real-time, especially over wireless links.\nClassical communication approaches in MAS often rely\non predefined protocols or fully connected message pass-\ning structures that assume unrestricted communication.\nThese models struggle in resource-constrained settings.\nMoreover, communication protocols in MAS have tra-\nditionally focused on information fidelity or throughput.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, these metrics fall\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Agents must therefore\nprioritize what to communicate, potentially compressing\nor omitting less relevant data.\n\u2022The distributed architecture of MAS means that there\nis often no centralized controller with global knowledge.\nEach agent must make decisions based on partial, noisy,\nor outdated information. Communication becomes a tool\nnot only for sharing state but for aligning beliefs and\ncoordinating actions under uncertainty.\n\u2022Partial observability further complicates message design.\nWhen agents have incomplete or private observations\nof the environment, they must infer what others know,\nanticipate their actions, and tailor messages accordingly.\nThis creates a form of nested reasoning that is both\ncomputationally and communicatively demanding.\n\u2022Another limitation lies in the separation of communi-\ncation and decision-making modules . In many standard\narchitectures, agents first communicate and then make de-\ncisions, regardless of whether the exchanged information\nis critical for the decision-making process. Such decou-\npling fails to exploit the potential of jointly optimizing\nmessaging and action policies in service of a common\ntask.\n\u2022Finally, with increasing heterogeneity of agents (differing\nin sensors, objectives, or capabilities), fixed communica-\ntion topologies or uniform message policies can result in\nredundant information sharing, overload, or irrelevance,\nthus deteriorating coordination. Such heterogeneity ne-\ncessitates flexible, adaptive protocols rather than static\nmessage formats.\nThese constraints motivate a rethinking of communication\nstrategies: not simply how to convey information accurately,\nbut what is worth communicating, given the task and context.\nThe paradigm of goal-oriented communication (often re-\nferred to as task-driven messaging1) shifts the focus from\ntransmitting information for its own sake to transmitting only\nwhat is useful for achieving a specific task [14]. This shift\nis particularly vital in cases where bandwidth, energy, or\nlatency constraints are present, as excessive or irrelevant\ncommunication can degrade system performance or even\nrender coordination infeasible. From this perspective, the\ninsight is that the utility of a message should be assessed by\nits contribution to achieving a collective objective. Agents\nmust therefore learn or infer what to communicate, when\nto communicate, and with whom to communicate, in a\n1Task-driven messaging refers to the design and use of communication\nprotocols where information is exchanged solely based on its utility toward\naccomplishing a specific goal. Unlike traditional paradigms that emphasize\ninformation fidelity or throughput, task-driven communication prioritizes\nrelevance, efficiency, and the impact of coordination.manner that maximizes task performance under real-world\nconstraints. In practice, goal-oriented messaging may man-\nifest as sparse message passing, event-triggered communi-\ncation, or the emergence of protocol learning in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning settings. These approaches all share a\ncommon goal: aligning communication behavior with task-\nspecific objectives and constraints.\nA. Relation between goal-oriented versus semantic com-\nmunication\nBefore delving more into goal-oriented communication for\nMASs, we should clarify that goal-oriented communication\nand semantic communication represent two distinct yet in-\nterconnected paradigms in next-generation wireless systems.\nSemantic communication primarily focuses on understanding\nand transmitting the semantics of information rather than raw\nbits. The framework extracts semantic content elements from\nraw data streams, employs causal reasoning and contextual\nawareness, and emphasizes the properties of minimalism,\ngeneralizability, and efficiency in its representations.\nIn contrast, goal-oriented communication emphasizes opti-\nmizing communication strategies to achieve specific tasks or\nobjectives, particularly in MASs. This paradigm tailors com-\nmunication protocols to maximize task performance and co-\nordination efficiency among distributed agents. Goal-oriented\ncommunication explicitly ties all messaging decisions to task\nsuccess metrics, carefully considers resource constraints and\nutility functions, and emphasizes coordination and coop-\neration among multiple agents working toward shared or\ncomplementary objectives. The success of such systems is\nmeasured not by the fidelity of information transmission, but\nby how effectively communication serves the overall system\ngoals and task completion.\nHowever, these approaches are not mutually exclusive but\nrather complementary frameworks that can work synergis-\ntically. The goal of the considered communication problem\nprovides the necessary context for the appropriate definition\nof the semantics of information. This becomes relevant since\nit can allow for efficient prioritization of information and\nefficient resource allocation leading to significantly reducing\nthe wastage of resources [15]\u2013[19]. Goal-oriented commu-\nnication is often considered the first major application of se-\nmantic communication, as goal-oriented systems frequently\nrequire semantic representations to achieve their objectives\nefficiently [18].\nB. Scope and contributions of the overview\nCommunication is a fundamental enabler of coordination,\nperception, and control in MASs. From autonomous driving\nto robotic swarms, collaborative agents must frequently\nexchange information to form consistent world models, syn-\nchronize behaviors, and jointly complete tasks. Traditionally,\ncommunication frameworks have focused on reconstructing\nthe transmitted signals or states with high fidelity, following\nprinciples laid out by classical Shannon theory. However, in\n2 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nmany real-world tasks, perfect reconstruction is not neces-\nsary, what matters is whether the received message enables\nthe receiver to act effectively toward its goal. This shift from\ntransmission fidelity togoal relevance has sparked growing\ninterest in goal-oriented communication; see, for example,\n[15]\u2013[17] and references therein.\nThis overview offers a comprehensive and integrative\noverview of goal-oriented communication in MASs, with\na focus on information-theoretic models and learning-based\napproaches. Specifically, we:\n\u2022Recap classical communication theory) and discuss its\nlimitations for intelligent, goal-oriented communications\n(Section II).\n\u2022Describe theoretical frameworks of wireless networked\ncontrol systems (WNCSs) and discuss issues related to\ncontrol systhesis and remote estimator design (Section II).\n\u2022Present a systematic overview of key information-\ntheoretic tools, such as the Information Bottleneck (IB),\nsemantic rate-distortion (SRD) theory, and G theory, that\nquantify and guide purposeful communication. Also, we\ndiscuss how these tools can be conceptually integrated\ninto a unified framework (Section III).\n\u2022Examine how goal-oriented principles reshape coordi-\nnation and control in MASs when communication is\ncostly or constrained. We build on models from wireless\nnetworked control (Section II) and introduces priority\nmetrics (such as Cost of Information Loss, Value of\nInformation, and Age of Information), and analyzes the\nimpact of shared and unreliable channels (Section IV).\n\u2022Cover approaches where communication strategies are\nlearned, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MARL), sparsity/attention mechanisms, and semantic\nrepresentation learning. Additionally, we aim at highlight-\ning connections and synergies between learning, informa-\ntion theory, and semantic communication (Section V).\n\u2022Illustrate the practical significance of goal-oriented com-\nmunication through selected applications: cooperative au-\ntonomous vehicles, distributed SLAM, federated learning,\nand edge intelligence. Each example demonstrates unique\nchallenges and solutions enabled by goal-oriented design\n(Section VI).\n\u2022Identify open research directions, including hierarchical\nrepresentations, causal semantic compression, and goal-\noriented coordination under uncertainty (Section VII).\n\u2022Summarize the key insights, reiterate the contribution\nof the overview, and encourage further research at the\nintersection of communication theory, semantics, and in-\ntelligent systems (Section VIII).\nWe aim to bridge the conceptual foundations of informa-\ntion theory with emerging practices in distributed learning,\ncontrol, and perception, establishing a common language\nfor researchers and practitioners working on semantic and\ngoal-oriented communication. By placing goal-oriented mes-\nsaging at the intersection of theory and application, weseek to accelerate the development of scalable, interpretable,\nand context-aware communication strategies, thus enabling\nagents to exchange information not merely to share data, but\nto advance shared objectives. This overview thus provides\nboth conceptual clarity and practical guidance for design-\ning intelligent, purpose-driven communication protocols in\nmulti-agent environments.\nC. Prior works\nWhile several contributions have advanced the field of\ngoal-oriented communications from multiple angles, rang-\ning from distributed simultaneous localization and mapping\n(SLAM) and decentralized control to semantic coding and\nIB theory, research remains fragmented across disciplines.\nRecently, several survey and tutorial papers have emerged ad-\ndressing goal-oriented communication, reflecting the grow-\ning interest in communication efficiency for intelligent sys-\ntems; see, for example, [15]\u2013[21] and references therein.\nThe survey and tutorial paper [18] presents a visionary,\ntutorial-style framework for evolving from data-centric to\nknowledge- and reasoning-driven semantic communication\nsystems and provides a comprehensive roadmap for scal-\nable, reasoning-driven, semantic communication networks\nin large-scale cellular environments. Finally, they discuss\nwhat challenges still lie ahead for plugging these ideas\ninto large-scale 6G networks. Overall, the paper provides a\nfoundational, holistic vision of semantic communication for\n6G, for the fundamental transformation of communication\ninto a knowledge and reasoning-driven paradigm, while our\nwork provides an in-depth exploration of a specific, critical\napplication of this vision, namely goal-oriented communica-\ntion within the complex domain of MASs.\nKountouris and Pappas in [15] introduce a multiscale\nsemantic definition spanning source-level event importance,\nlink-level attributes (freshness, timeliness), and system-level\nimpact on application objectives, enabling smart devices\nto perform active, semantics-aware sampling that reduces\nredundancy and resource waste. Through a real-time re-\nmote actuation case study, they demonstrate that semantics-\nempowered policies achieve fewer uninformative samples,\nlower reconstruction error, and reduced costly actuation mis-\ntakes compared to classical approaches. The work identifies\nkey open challenges including concrete semantic metrics,\ngoal-oriented resource orchestration, and scalable optimiza-\ntion frameworks, positioning semantic communication as the\nfoundation for next-generation networked intelligence.\nThe paper by Zhou et al. [16] presents a comprehensive\ngoal-oriented semantic communication framework specifi-\ncally designed for 6G networks that goes beyond traditional\nsemantic approaches by incorporating both semantic-level\ninformation extraction and effectiveness-aware performance\nmetrics tailored to diverse application requirements. The\nframework\u2019s practical effectiveness is demonstrated through\na unmanned aerial vehicle (UA V) control case study, where\nAoI and V oI metrics enable intelligent filtering of redun-\nVOLUME , 3\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\ndant command signals, achieving over 60% reduction in\ndata transmission while maintaining control effectiveness.\nThis paper is systems-oriented and implementation-focused,\nproviding operational solutions for specific use cases. Our\noverview is more foundational and mathematical, aiming\nto address the fundamental theoretical gaps. Hence, they\nare essentially complementary perspectives on the same\ncommunication paradigm.\nTrevlakis et al. [17] surveys and categorizes a wide range\nof recent works on semantic and goal-oriented communi-\ncation, including fundamental theories, architectural mod-\nels, enabling techniques, deep learning, knowledge graphs,\nand practical implementations. Additionally, it introduces\na semantic networking architecture that evolves traditional\npoint-to-point communication into a distributed, multi-user,\nedge-to-cloud paradigm. This architecture enables the ex-\ntraction and filtering of goal-specific semantic information at\nthe source and post-processing/decoding at the destination.\nWhile it includes goal-oriented communications within its\nscope, it does not provide the in-depth survey of MASs\u2019\ncommunication challenges and approaches offered herein.\nThe paper by Li et al. [19] introduces the Goal-Oriented\nTensor (GoT) as a unified metric for semantic communi-\ncation in 6G networks, capturing both the semantic signif-\nicance of information and its impact on task effectiveness.\nThe authors propose a holistic architecture where semantic\nquantization, sparse semantics-aware sampling, goal-oriented\nchannel coding, and intelligent decision making collaborate\nto minimize real-world costs. They validate GoT through a\nfire monitoring and rescue case study, demonstrating its su-\nperiority in selective sampling and cost reduction. While this\npaper focuses on a practical metric unification and system\ndesign, providing an applied, tensor-based metric and archi-\ntecture tailored for real-world 6G scenarios, our overview\nlays the mathematical groundwork for goal-oriented com-\nmunications, emphasizing the theoretical foundations.\nXin et al. [20] explores semantic information theory,\ncovering major topics and discusses how these concepts\nextend and differ from classical Shannon information theory,\nemphasizing the urgent need for a unified theoretical frame-\nwork for semantic communications. However, the paper\nfocuses solely on semantic information theory and reviews\nseveral mathematical theories and tools and evaluates their\napplicability in the context of semantic communication.\nThe paper by Getu et al. [21] provides a comprehensive\nreview of existing metrics for evaluating both semantic com-\nmunication and specifically goal-oriented communication\nacross wireless, optical, and quantum domains. It addresses\nthe need for unified performance metrics and covers topics\nlike semantic metrics for text, speech, image, video, resource\nallocation, and system throughput. The survey highlights\nresearch directions for 6G and beyond. Nevertheless, MAS\nscenarios require an additional higher-level integration step\nto couple such metrics with decision impact and coordination\nefficiency in decentralized settings.D. How this work differs\nDespite the breadth of recent work, the literature on\nsemantic and goal-oriented communication remains frag-\nmented across multiple research communities, including\ninformation theory, control and robotics, distributed AI, and\nnetworking, each advancing its own set of models, metrics,\nand application scenarios. While these studies have produced\nimportant theoretical insights and compelling application-\nspecific demonstrations, they often lack a unifying frame-\nwork that connects foundational principles to the specific\ncoordination and decision-making challenges encountered in\nMASs. In particular, few works integrate communication\nefficiency, semantic relevance, and task performance within\na single end-to-end perspective, or address the nuanced\nrequirements of safety-critical and human-centric environ-\nments. This gap motivates the present overview.\nWhile recent surveys and tutorials on semantic and goal-\noriented communication have introduced valuable concepts\nand demonstrated isolated case studies, they have not pro-\nvided a comprehensive, MAS-centric synthesis that unifies\ntheoretical foundations with practical deployment consid-\nerations. Existing works often examine semantic signaling\nin isolation from resource constraints, or focus on AI-\ndriven link-level solutions without establishing a rigorous\nconnection to end-to-end multi-agent objectives. Moreover,\nsafety-critical and human-centric dimensions are frequently\ntreated as peripheral topics rather than core design drivers.\nIn contrast, this paper delivers a unified, conceptually rigor-\nous framework for goal-oriented communication in MASs,\ndistinguished by the following key contributions:\n\u2022It integrates information-theoretic principles with dis-\ntributed control/estimation and robotics models, as well\nas emerging learning-based architectures, aiming at cre-\nating a shared formalism applicable across heterogeneous\nMASs domains.\n\u2022It emphasizes messaging whose primary purpose is to\nadvance joint agent objectives, ensuring efficiency (mini-\nmizing communication overhead) and effectiveness (max-\nimizing task performance) under real-world constraints.\n\u2022It bridges theory and practice by aligning mathematical\nprinciples with concrete MASs use cases, enabling the\ndesign of flexible, goal-oriented protocols that emphasize\nactionable information instead of simply preserving raw\ndata, exploring how these models can be combined in\nMASs with real-world constraints (e.g., limited observ-\nability, decentralized optimization).\nRather than merely cataloging existing contributions, our\nwork distills their essential mechanisms and organizes them\ninto a cohesive framework tailored for MASs applications,\nguiding the design of communications that are both resource-\naware and tightly coupled to agent goals. This transition is\ncritical for the next decade\u2019s communication and networking\nneeds, especially given the demands of emerging applica-\ntions (e.g., cooperative autonomous systems and distributed\nAI/ML).\n4 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nII. Foundations of Goal-Oriented Communication\nA. Classical Communication Theory\nShannon\u2019s classical information theory [22], [23] provides\nthe foundational framework for modeling and analyzing\ncommunication systems. In its canonical form, communi-\ncation is viewed as the process of mapping symbols from\na source X\u2208 X through an encoder, transmitting them\nover a possibly noisy channel characterized by a conditional\ndistribution p(y|x) =P(Y=y|X=x), and producing\nan output Y\u2208 Y at the receiver. The primary objective\nof such a system is to ensure that the receiver obtains\nsufficient information to accurately infer or reconstruct the\ntransmitted data, subject to channel limitations. The theory\nabstracts away semantic communication, focusing instead on\nthestatistical relationship between XandY.\n1) Entropy\nLetXbe a discrete random variable with alphabet Xand\nprobability mass function p(x)\u2261pX(x) =P(X=x). The\nShannon entropy ofXis defined as:\nH(X) =\u2212X\nx\u2208Xp(x) log2p(x), (1)\nwhere the logarithm is taken base 2and the entropy is mea-\nsured in bits. The entropy quantifies the average uncertainty\nor information content in the random variable X. It reaches\nits maximum when Xis uniformly distributed over X, and\nequals zero when Xis deterministic.\n2) Mutual Information\nA central quantity in Shannon\u2019s theory is the mutual infor-\nmation I(X;Y), which quantifies the amount of information\nthat the output Yconveys about the input X. It is defined\nas the reduction in uncertainty about Xafter observing Y,\nand can be expressed in terms of the entropy function H(\u00b7)\nas:\nI(X;Y) =H(X)\u2212H(X|Y), (2)\nwhere H(X)is the entropy of the source and H(X|Y)is\nthe conditional entropy of Xgiven Y, given by:\nH(X|Y) =\u2212X\ny\u2208Yp(y)X\nx\u2208Xp(x|y) log2p(x|y).(3)\nEquivalently, it can be written using the joint distribution as:\nH(X|Y) =\u2212X\nx\u2208XX\ny\u2208Yp(x, y) log2p(x|y). (4)\nThe conditional entropy quantifies the average uncertainty\nremaining about Xafter observing Y. Therefore, the mutual\ninformation can also be written as:\nI(X;Y) =X\nx\u2208XX\ny\u2208Yp(x, y) logp(x, y)\np(x)p(y), (5)\nwhere p(x, y)is the joint probability distribution of XandY,\nandp(x),p(y)are the marginal distributions. This measure\ncaptures the statistical dependence between the transmitted\nand received signals. For discrete random variables X,Y,andZwith joint probability mass function p(x, y, z ), the\nconditional mutual information of XandYgiven Zis\ndefined by\nI(X;Y|Z)\u225cH(X|Z)\u2212H(X|Y, Z) (6)\n=X\nx\u2208XX\ny\u2208YX\nz\u2208Zp(x, y, z ) logp(x, y|z)\np(x|z)p(y|z).\nMaking use of (6), for multiple random variables, the fol-\nlowing result holds:\nI(X1, X2, . . . , X n;Y)=nX\ni=1I(Xi;Y|Xi\u22121, . . . , X 1).(7)\nShannon also introduced the notion of channel capacity C,\ndefined as the maximum mutual information achievable over\nthe channel:\nC= max\np(x)I(X;Y), (8)\nwhich represents the highest rate at which information can\nbe reliably transmitted across the channel. Together, these\nconcepts form the basis for understanding the limits of\ncommunication under noise and bandwidth constraints.\nWhen exact reconstruction of a source is not necessary\nor feasible (such as in image compression, video stream-\ning, or real-time sensing), rate-distortion theory provides a\nframework to study lossy source compression [24]. Instead\nof requiring perfect fidelity, the goal is to find an optimal\ntrade-off between the number of bits used for encoding and\nthe quality of reconstruction, as measured by a distortion\nmetric. Distortion is measured in terms of signal fidelity;\ne.g., mean squared error or Hamming distance.\nConsider a memoryless source X\u2208 X with known distri-\nbution p(x), and a reproduction alphabet \u02c6X. Letd(x,\u02c6x)\u22650\nbe a distortion function that quantifies how \u201cclose\u201d a re-\nconstruction \u02c6x\u2208\u02c6Xis to the true source value x\u2208 X .\nThe encoder maps each source symbol to a codeword, and\nthe decoder reconstructs a symbol \u02c6x. The pair (X,\u02c6X)then\nfollows a joint distribution p(x,\u02c6x) = p(x)p(\u02c6x|x), where\np(\u02c6x|x)defines a (possibly stochastic) reconstruction rule.\nThe expected distortion is given by:\nE[d(X,\u02c6X)] =X\nx\u2208XX\n\u02c6x\u2208\u02c6Xp(x)p(\u02c6x|x)d(x,\u02c6x). (9)\n3) Rate distortion theory\nRate-distortion theory, introduced by Shannon in 1959\n[25], provides the fundamental theoretical framework for\nunderstanding the trade-off between compression efficiency\nand reconstruction fidelity in lossy data compression. This\ntheory addresses the question: What is the minimum amount\nof information (rate) required to represent a source such that\nit can be reconstructed with a specified level of distortion?\nUnlike lossless compression, which seeks perfect recon-\nstruction, rate-distortion theory acknowledges that in many\npractical scenarios, perfect fidelity is neither necessary nor\nachievable under bandwidth constraints, making controlled\ndistortion an acceptable compromise.\nVOLUME , 5\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nThe cornerstone of rate-distortion theory is the rate-\ndistortion function , which characterizes the minimum achiev-\nable rate R(measured in bits per symbol) required to\ntransmit a source under a distortion constraint D. Formally,\nit is defined as:\nR(D) = min\np(\u02c6x|x):E[d(X,\u02c6X)]\u2264DI(X;\u02c6X), (10)\nwhere I(X;\u02c6X)represents the mutual information between\nthe source Xand its reconstruction \u02c6X, and d(X,\u02c6X)is a\ndistortion measure that quantifies the difference between the\noriginal and reconstructed symbols. The minimization is per-\nformed over all conditional probability distributions p(\u02c6x|x)\n(representing different encoding strategies) that satisfy the\naverage distortion constraint E[d(X,\u02c6X)]\u2264D. The rate-\ndistortion function R(D)is a convex, non-increasing func-\ntion of Dthat describes the fundamental trade-off between\ncompression rate and reconstruction quality.\nThe choice of distortion measure d(X,\u02c6X)signifi-\ncantly impacts the rate-distortion function and reflects the\napplication-specific notion of reconstruction quality. Com-\nmon distortion measures include:\n\u2022Squared Error Distortion :d(x,\u02c6x) = (x\u2212\u02c6x)2, widely used\nfor continuous sources;\n\u2022Hamming Distortion :d(x,\u02c6x) =1x\u0338=\u02c6x, appropriate for\ndiscrete sources;\n\u2022Absolute Error :d(x,\u02c6x) =|x\u2212\u02c6x|, used in robust appli-\ncations.\nFor specific source distributions and distortion measures,\nclosed-form expressions for R(D)can be derived. A fun-\ndamental result is the rate-distortion function for a Gaussian\nsource with squared error distortion:\nR(D) =(\n1\n2log2\u03c32\nD,ifD\u2264\u03c32\n0, ifD > \u03c32(11)\nwhere \u03c32is the source variance. This result demonstrates\nthe logarithmic relationship between rate and distortion for\nGaussian sources, a relationship that appears frequently in\npractical compression systems.\nThe rate-distortion function provides both a lower bound\non compression performance and a roadmap for optimal\nencoder design. The rate-distortion theorem establishes that\nfor any rate R > R (D), there exist encoding and decoding\nschemes that achieve average distortion arbitrarily close to D\nwith sufficiently long block lengths. Conversely, no encoding\nscheme can achieve average distortion Dwith rate less than\nR(D). This operational interpretation is realized through\nthe concept of typical sequences and jointly typical en-\ncoding/decoding . The optimal encoder partitions the source\nspace into regions, assigning codewords to representative\npoints (centroids) within each region. The decoder maps\nreceived codewords back to these centroids, achieving the\nminimum distortion for a given rate. Rate-distortion theory\nunderlies the design of virtually all modern compression\nalgorithms. In practice, this theory underlies the designof compression algorithms (e.g., JPEG, MP3, H.264) by\nquantifying the best possible trade-off between rate and\nquality. For a comprehensive treatment of rate\u2013distortion\ntheory, the reader is also referred to [24].\n4) Limitations of classical communication theory\nWhile classical information theory offers a mathematically\nelegant and universally applicable framework, its standard\ndistortion measures are fundamentally task-agnostic : i.e.,\nthey treat all deviations equally, regardless of their semantic\nor functional significance. For example, an agent performing\nclassification may tolerate significant pixel-level noise, pro-\nvided that the semantic content (e.g., object category) is pre-\nserved. This mismatch between fidelity (accuracy of signal\nreconstruction) and utility (contribution to the intended task)\nbecomes critical in modern multi-agent and cyber\u2013physical\nsystems, where communication is increasingly embedded\nwithin decision-making loops. In such contexts, transmitting\nevery detail of the source signal is not only unnecessary\nbut often leads to overall performance deterioration. These\nobservations motivate a paradigm shift toward goal-oriented\ncommunication , in which compression, coding, and trans-\nmission are explicitly optimized to preserve information\nthat is relevant for achieving the system\u2019s objective. By\naligning communication metrics with task-specific utility,\nsuch approaches can dramatically improve efficiency while\nmaintaining or even enhancing decision quality. We explore\nthis extension in the Section III.\nB. Wireless networked control systems (WNCSs)\nA WNCS is a feedback control architecture where sensors,\ncontrollers, and actuators (may) communicate over wireless\nlinks. In such systems, deciding when to transmit sensor data\nis critical due to shared channel access, power limitations,\nand real-time performance demands. This decision is typi-\ncally governed by a transmission policy that initiates com-\nmunication when new information significantly improves es-\ntimation or control and suppresses communication when data\nis redundant or contributes little to task performance. Such\npolicies can be event-triggered, self-triggered, or based on\nvalue-aware decision metrics, and are designed to minimize\ncommunication load while maintaining control quality.\nConsider the simplified model of a system that closes its\nloop over a network as depicted in Figure 1.\nPlant Sensor\nController\nSchedulerWireless\nChannel\nFIGURE 1. A system consisting of a plant, a sensor and a controller\ncloses the loop through a network. The channel access decision is\ndetermined by the (goal-oriented) scheduler block.\n6 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nWithout getting into the specifics yet, we assume that the\ntransmission policy is captured by the scheduler block.\nThis allows us to, without loss of generality, represent the\nfundamentals with simplified notation. The plant dynamics\nare described by a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time\nsystem:\nxk+1=Axk+Buk+wk, (12)\nwhere xk\u2208Rnanduk\u2208Rmrepresent the state and\ncontrol input at time k, respectively. The matrices A\u2208Rn\u00d7n\nandB\u2208Rn\u00d7mare time-invariant and of appropriate\ndimensions. The process noise wk\u2208Rnis a zero-mean\nGaussian random variable with covariance W, and the initial\nstate x0is Gaussian with mean \u00afx0and covariance X0. The\nsensor Sobserves the system through a linear measurement\nmodel:\nyk=Cxk+vk, (13)\nwhere yk\u2208Rpis the measurement, C\u2208Rp\u00d7nis the output\nmatrix, and vk\u2208Rpis a zero-mean Gaussian noise term\nwith covariance V. The random variables x0,wk, and vk\nare assumed to be mutually independent. Upon obtaining a\nmeasurement, the sensor constructs a data packet. Whether\nthis packet is transmitted to the controller Cis determined\nby a binary channel access decision variable \u03b4k\u2208 {0,1},\ndefined as:\n\u03b4k=(\n1,if the sensor transmits at time k,\n0,otherwise .(14)\nIn case of unreliable communication channels packet\ndropouts are possible. We consider the case for which\ninstantaneous packet acknowledgements/negative-acknow-\nledgements (ACK/NACKs) are available through an error-\nfree feedback channel and define\n\u03b3k=(\n1,if\u03b4k=1and packet successfully received ,\n0,otherwise .\n(15)\nFirst, we focus on a setting where the network is modeled\nas a single ideal communication channel. As a result, when\nchannel access is granted (i.e., \u03b4k= 1), the corresponding\ndata packet is successfully received by the controller without\nloss or interference. In addition, we define\ntk= min {\u03ba\u22650 :\u03b4k\u2212\u03ba= 1} (16)\nas the time elapsed since the most recent successful packet\nreception at the controller. Based on these definitions, the\ninformation set available at the sensor at time kis denoted\nbyIs\nk={yk,uk\u22121,\u03b4k\u22121}, where boldface notation (e.g.,\n\u03b4k\u22121={\u03b40, \u03b41, . . . , \u03b4 k\u22121}) is used to represent sequences\nof variables up to time k\u22121. The controller\u2019s information\nset is given by Ic\nk={yk\u2212tk,uk\u22121,\u03b4k}, reflecting the\nsensing and estimation architecture, which will be elaborated\nin the subsequent section. Additionally, the information set\navailable at the scheduler is denoted by I\u03c4\nk. While itsstructure will be described in detail later, for now we assume\nthat it satisfies Ic\nk\u22121\u2286 I\u03c4\nk.\nLet the channel access policy d={d0, d1, . . . , d K\u22121}and\ncontrol policy f={f0, f1, . . . , f K\u22121}denote the admissible\npolicies for the finite horizon Kwith\n\u03b4k=dk(I\u03c4\nk), (17)\nuk=fk(Ic\nk), (18)\nwhere the mappings dkandfkare measurable mappings of\ntheir available information.\nThe objective is to find the optimal channel access and\ncontrol policy that minimize the standard quadratic cost over\nthe infinite horizon, i.e.,\nmin\nd,fJ0:\u221e, (19)\nwhere\nJ0:\u221e= lim\nK\u2192\u221e1\nKE(K\u22121X\nk=0\u0000\nxT\nkQxk+uT\nkRuk\u0001)\n,(20)\nis the quadratic cost penalizing the deviation of the states and\ninputs from their reference values with respective positive\nsemi-definite and positive definite weighting matrices Qand\nR.\nThe simplistic always transmit policy, where the sensor\nsends its measurement at every time step regardless of\ncontent or context, is suboptimal in many practical scenar-\nios. While this strategy ensures that the controller receives\nthe freshest possible data, it completely disregards com-\nmunication costs, bandwidth constraints, and the potential\nredundancy of the transmitted information. In resource-\nlimited systems such as WCNs, constant transmission leads\nto channel congestion, increased energy consumption, and\ninefficient use of communication resources.\nMoreover, in goal-oriented settings, not all information\nupdates contribute equally to task performance. For example,\nwhen the system state evolves slowly or remains within\npredictable bounds, transmitting every measurement offers\nlittle improvement in estimation or control accuracy. In-\nstead, selective transmission policies (e.g., based on event-\ntriggering, prediction error, or task-relevance metrics) can\nreduce communication load while maintaining or even im-\nproving overall system performance [26]\u2013[28].\n1) Separation of channel access scheme and controller\ndesign\nDespite the complexities involved in the joint optimization\nof channel access and control policies, under certain condi-\ntions, their design can be separated in the sense that (19) can\nbe rewritten as\nmin\nd\u001a\nmin\nfJ0:\u221e\u001b\n. (21)\nIn this regard, we first review the conditions on the channel\naccess policy which ensure that the certainty equivalence\nprinciple holds. As a consequence, the classical results\nin stochastic control theory can be adopted to design the\nVOLUME , 7\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\noptimal controller. We then present the detailed model of\nthe sensing and estimation architecture and finally derive an\nequivalent problem formulation for designing the channel\naccess policy.\nThe deterministic optimal controller refers to the control\npolicy that minimizes the cost function in (20) under the\nassumption of perfect information, i.e., full knowledge of\nthe exact realizations of all involved random variables. Let\n\u00afukdenote the optimal control input at time kin this ide-\nalized setting. Importantly, under the certainty equivalence\nprinciple , there is no loss in optimality when the controller\ninstead applies the conditional expectation E{\u00afuk|Ic\nk}, com-\nputed using the available (partial and noisy) information set\nIc\nk. This principle, as formalized in [29], ensures that the\nseparation between estimation and control remains optimal\nin linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) settings.\nDefinition 1 (Certainty equivalence principle):\nThe certainty equivalence principle holds if the closed-\nloop optimal controller has the same form as the certainty\nequivalent controller.\nDefinition 2 (Certainty equivalent controller):\nA certainty equivalent controller uses the deterministic op-\ntimal controller, with the state xi,kreplaced by the estimate\n\u02c6xk|k=E{xk|Ic\nk}.\n2) Controller synthesis\nThe case under consideration in non-classical and, as a\nresult, the applicability of the certainty equivalence principle\nis no longer guaranteed by default. However, it has been\nshown that certainty equivalence continues to hold under\nspecific structural conditions; that is, when the channel\naccess decisions are independent of the control actions.\nThis requirement is satisfied if the scheduling policy is\nsolely a function of the system\u2019s primitive random variables.\nFormally, the channel access decision at time kmust take the\nform \u03b4k=dk(x0,wk\u22121,vk\u22121)for all k\u2208 {0,1, . . . , K \u2212\n1}[30]. Under this assumption, the control and estimation\nproblems decouple, allowing for the use of a certainty\nequivalent controller. By employing a dynamic programming\nframework, one can derive the optimal control law that\nminimizes the expected cost given partial information. The\nresulting certainty equivalent controller corresponds to the\nstandard LQG form, as detailed in [31, Chapter 8], given by\nuk=L\u221e\u02c6xk|k, (22)\nwhere the optimal feedback gain L\u221eis given by\nL\u221e=\u2212(BT\u03a0\u221eB+R)\u22121BT\u03a0\u221eA, (23)\nand\u03a0\u221eis the positive semi-definite solution of the following\ndiscrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE)\n\u03a0\u221e=AT\u03a0\u221eA+Q\u2212LT\n\u221e(BT\u03a0\u221eB+R)L\u221e.(24)We assume that the pair (A, B)and(A, Q1/2)are con-\ntrollable and observable, respectively, to guarantee that \u03a0\u221e\nalways exists.\nIt is important to emphasize that, while restricting the\nchannel access policy to exclude dependence on past control\ninputs guarantees the validity of the certainty equivalence\nprinciple, this restriction does not, in general, yield the\noptimal solution. Nevertheless, such a constraint simplifies\nthe optimization problem by making the formulation in (21)\nequivalent to the decoupled control problem in (19). This\nsignificantly facilitates the design of the channel access\npolicy, as the optimal control law is known a priori and cor-\nresponds to the classical certainty equivalent controller given\nby (22). However, allowing the channel access decisions\nto depend on past control inputs can, in general, improve\nsystem performance. In such cases, the certainty equivalent\ncontroller may no longer be optimal, since the control actions\ninfluence both the system state and the information available\nto the controller. As a result, the joint optimization problem\ndescribed in (19) must be solved in its full generality [30].\n3) Estimator design\nThe control input in (22) is computed using the state\nestimate \u02c6xk|k=E{xk|Ic\nk}, which is based on the infor-\nmation available to the controller at time k. To formalize\nthe structure of Ic\nkand the computation of \u02c6xk|k, we begin\nby describing the sensor\u2019s operation and the contents of the\ndata packet it generates.\nWe assume that the systems is equipped with smart sen-\nsors, meaning that each sensor possesses local computational\ncapabilities. This enables the sensors to autonomously assess\nthe necessity of transmission and actively participate in\nchannel access decisions. More importantly, the use of smart\nsensors, as opposed to primitive, computation-limited ones,\nallows for local preprocessing of raw measurements prior to\ntransmission, which has been shown to significantly enhance\nestimation quality at the receiver [32].\nAt the beginning of transmission frame k, the information\navailable to the sensor is given by Is\nk={yk,uk\u22121,\u03b4k\u22121}.\nNotably, knowledge of past channel access decisions \u03b4k\u22121\nallows the sensor to infer the past control inputs uk\u22121with-\nout requiring explicit communication from the controller.\nWe define the a priori anda posteriori state estimates at\nthe sensor as\n\u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121\u225cE{xk|Is\nk\u22121},\n\u02c6xs\nk|k\u225cE{xk|Is\nk},\nwith their corresponding estimation error covariances given\nby\nPs\nk|k\u22121\u225cE\b\n(xk\u2212\u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121)(xk\u2212\u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121)T|Is\nk\u22121\t\n,\nPs\nk|k\u225cE\b\n(xk\u2212\u02c6xs\nk|k)(xk\u2212\u02c6xs\nk|k)T|Is\nk\t\n.\nThe sensor runs a local Kalman filter to recursively\ncompute the state estimate \u02c6xs\nk|k.

(26)\nThen, the recursive Kalman filtering equations at the sensor\nare given by:\n\u02c6xs\nk|k= \u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121+Kk(yk\u2212C\u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121), (27a)\n\u02c6xs\nk+1|k=A\u02c6xs\nk|k+Buk, (27b)\nPs\nk|k=g\u25e6h(Ps\nk\u22121|k\u22121), (27c)\nPs\nk+1|k=h(Ps\nk|k), (27d)\nKk+1=Ps\nk+1|kCT\u0000\nCPs\nk+1|kCT+V\u0001\u22121, (27e)\nwhere g\u25e6h(\u00b7)\u225cg(h(\u00b7))denotes function composition, and\nthe initial conditions are \u02c6xs\n0|\u22121= 0 andPs\n0|\u22121=X0.\nSince the sensor has uninterrupted access to the mea-\nsurements, the estimation error covariance converges ex-\nponentially fast [33]. Assuming that the pair (A, C)is\nobservable and (A, W1/2)is controllable, the fixed-point\nequation g\u25e6h(X) = Xadmits a unique positive semi-\ndefinite solution, denoted by \u00afP[33]. Hence, we assume the\nfilter has reached steady state, so that Ps\nk|k=\u00afPfor all k,\nwhich is a standard assumption in the literature [34]\u2013[39].\nUnder this assumption, the filtering equations simplify to the\ntime-invariant form:\n\u02c6xs\nk|k= \u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121+K(yk\u2212C\u02c6xs\nk|k\u22121), (28)\n\u02c6xs\nk+1|k=A\u02c6xs\nk|k+Buk, (29)\nwhere the steady-state Kalman gain is given by:\nK=h(\u00afP)CT\u0000\nCh(\u00afP)CT+V\u0001\u22121. (30)\nIf the sensor gains access to the channel at time k, it\ntransmits a data packet containing \u02c6xs\nk|kfrom (68a), which\nimplicitly conveys information about the sequence of recent\nmeasurements {yk\u2212tk\u22121+1, . . . , y k}to the controller [40].\nConsequently, the information set available to the controller\nbecomes Ic\nk={yk\u2212tk,uk\u22121,\u03b4k}, and its state estimate and\ncorresponding error covariance are given by:\n\u02c6xk|k= (A+BL\u221e)tk\u02c6xs\nk\u2212tk|k\u2212tk, (31)\nPk|k=htk(\u00afP), (32)\nwhere h0(X)\u225cXandht(X)denotes the t-fold composi-\ntion of h.\n4) From Single to Multiple Wireless Networked Control\nSystems: Limitations and Challenges\nWNCSs integrate control loops with wireless communi-\ncation, enabling flexible automation without rigid wiring.\nIn a single WNCS, the control loop typically involves a\nsensor, controller, and actuator that communicate over a\nshared wireless link. While this architecture is attractive for\ncost-effective and modular system design, it also introduces\nseveral limitations tightly coupled to the quality of its\ncommunication link. Key limitations include:\u2022Packet loss and delay: Wireless links are inherently unre-\nliable due to fading, interference, and congestion, which\ndegrade estimation and control performance.\n\u2022Energy constraints: In systems with battery-powered sen-\nsors or actuators, excessive communication reduces oper-\national lifespan.\n\u2022Trade-off between communication rate and control ac-\ncuracy: Frequent updates improve control quality but\nconsume more bandwidth and energy.\n\u2022Design complexity: Control and communication layers\nare traditionally designed separately, ignoring cross-layer\ndependencies that impact system stability and robustness.\nEven under idealized assumptions (e.g., memoryless chan-\nnels, perfect synchronization), designing event-triggered or\nstate-aware scheduling policies that optimize control per-\nformance while respecting communication constraints is a\nchallenging task. When scaling from a single WNCS to a\nnetwork of multiple WNCSs, e.g., in a MAS where each\nagent is a WNCS subsystem, the challenges compound\nsignificantly. These include:\n\u2022Shared wireless medium: Multiple WNCSs must contend\nfor access to a common communication channel, introduc-\ning collisions, interference, and scheduling complexity.\n\u2022Coupled control objectives: In MASs, agents often share\na global objective or must coordinate actions. This leads\nto coupling not only in control dynamics but also in\ncommunication dependencies.\n\u2022Scalability of scheduling: Centralized scheduling becomes\ninfeasible with many agents. Distributed or priority-based\npolicies must be employed. Designing such mechanisms\nwith performance guarantees remains an open problem.\n\u2022Asynchronous and heterogeneous dynamics: Agents may\noperate at different time scales or use different sensing\nmodalities, further complicating coordination.\n\u2022Information bottlenecks and redundancy: As more agents\nparticipate, ensuring that only task-relevant and non-\nredundant information is communicated becomes essen-\ntial to avoid congestion.\nThese challenges highlight the need for goal-oriented\ncommunication strategies in multi-agent WNCSs, where de-\ncisions about what ,when , and to whom to communicate are\nmade with the global task in mind [41]. We believe that by\nembedding goal-oriented relevance metrics into scheduling\nand encoding policies, MASs can overcome the limitations\nof traditional WNCS frameworks and scale effectively in\ndynamic, resource-constrained environments.\nRemark 1:\nSome initial studies that deal with the aforementioned topics\nwhen a receiver tracks remotely DTMCs with the purpose of\nremote actuation can be found in [41]\u2013[45]. In these studies\nrelevant metrics such as the Cost of Actuation Error andAge\nof Consecutive Error have been defined and studied under\ndifferent systems.\nVOLUME , 9\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nIII. Information-Theoretic Models of Goal-Oriented\nMessaging\nIn many real-world systems, particularly in multi-agent and\nrobotic scenarios, exact reconstruction of the source is not\nnecessary. Instead, what matters is whether the received\ninformation enables the receiver (e.g., an agent, controller,\nor decision module) to achieve its intended goal.\nA. Information bottleneck (IB)\nThe IB principle [46] provides a theoretical framework\nfor extracting relevant information from a source variable\nXwith respect to a target variable Y. Unlike traditional\ncompression approaches that aim to preserve all information\nabout X, the IB framework selectively retains only the\ncomponents of Xthat are informative about Y, thus enabling\npurposeful and task-driven representation. Formally, the IB\nmethod seeks a stochastic encoder p(t|x)that maps input\ndataXto a compressed representation T, such that Tretains\nmaximal mutual information about the task-relevant variable\nY, while being minimally dependent on the full input, i.e.,\nProblem 1:\nmin\np(t|x)I(X;T)subject to I(T;Y)\u2265\u03b2, (33)\nwhere I(\u00b7;\u00b7)denotes mutual information, and \u03b2is a tunable\nparameter that balances compression and relevance. Equiv-\nalently, the objective can be formulated in Lagrangian form\nas:\nLIB=I(X;T)\u2212\u03b2I(T;Y). (34)\nThis formulation defines a trade-off: reducing I(X;T)com-\npresses the representation, while maximizing I(T;Y)en-\nsures task-relevant information is retained. The optimal point\non this trade-off curve depends on the complexity of the task\nand the acceptable information loss. Here, Ymay represent\nlabels, control actions, or decisions. The IB principle basi-\ncally formalizes the trade-off between compression (removal\nof irrelevant information) and informativeness (preservation\nof task-relevant content).\nPractical implementation of the IB principle has been\nenabled by variational approximations , most notably the\nDeep Variational IB (VIB) [47]. In these models, the encoder\np(t|x)and decoder p(y|t)are parameterized using deep neu-\nral networks, and mutual information terms are approximated\nusing tractable variational bounds:\nLVIB=Ep(x,y)\u0002\nEp(t|x)[\u2212logp(y|t)]\u0003\n+\u03b2DKL(p(t|x)\u2225r(t)),\n(35)\nwhere r(t)is a prior distribution (e.g., standard Gaussian)\nandDKLis the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence [23]. This for-\nmulation closely resembles a regularized autoencoder with a\ntask-aware bottleneck.1) Implications of IB for MASs\nThe IB principle offers a compelling lens for designing\ncommunication protocols and internal representations that\nare both efficient and effective. Each agent may observe\nhigh-dimensional, partially observable environments and\nmust communicate compressed messages to other agents or\nto a centralized controller. Using IB-based objectives, agents\ncan learn to encode only the aspects of their observations\nthat are relevant to shared goals, or global rewards. For\ninstance, in distributed cooperative tasks, agent imay share\nembeddings Tiderived from its local observations Xi, with\nthe goal of maximizing performance on a joint task Y. By\napplying the IB principle, each agent can learn a mapping\nthat discards irrelevant or redundant features while preserv-\ning only what is needed for team-level coordination. This\nreduces communication overhead and supports robustness to\nnoise or spurious correlations in the inputs.\nB. Semantic rate distortion (SRD): Adapting for goal-\noriented communication\nTraditionally, distortion is measured in terms of signal\nfidelity (e.g., mean squared error or Hamming distance) but\nthe metric is task-agnostic: it does not account for how\ndistortion affects a downstream objective. This limitation\nhas motivated a growing interest in extending the notion\nof rate-distortion theory to incorporate task-aware distortion\nmeasures; see, for example, [48]\u2013[50] and references therein.\nIn this broader perspective, mutual information is not the\nfinal goal but a proxy that must be evaluated in the context\nof how the information contributes to a specific task. That\nis, high mutual information does not necessarily imply high\ntask performance. This divergence is a proxy to goal-oriented\nformulations that treat communication as purposeful, where\nrelevance to a task supersedes transmission fidelity.\nSDR theory extends Shannon\u2019s classical framework by pri-\noritizing task relevance over mere signal fidelity. Rather than\nminimizing reconstruction error across all data dimensions,\nsemantic extensions optimize communication to preserve the\ninformation that matters most for downstream objectives.\nThis shift enables communication systems to become both\nefficient and goal-oriented, especially in settings with strict\nbandwidth or energy constraints [48].\n1) Goal-oriented distortion/utility function\nIn semantic communication, the distortion function d(x,\u02c6x)\nis replaced with a task-aware cost metric. Let f:X \u2192 A\ndenote a decision task, such as classification, estimation, or\ncontrol, and let \u2113(\u00b7,\u00b7)measure task loss. The goal-oriented\ndistortion is defined as:\nds(x,\u02c6x) =\u2113\u0000\nf(x), f(\u02c6x)\u0001\n. (36)\nFor instance, in object detection, dscould represent align-\nment or miss rates of bounding boxes, rather than pixel-level\nerror. This criterion ensures communication resources focus\non transmitting information that directly influences decision\nquality, while allowing irrelevant details to be compressed\n10 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nor dropped [48]. An alternative formulation uses a goal-\noriented utility function u(x,\u02c6x), capturing the effectiveness\nof reconstructed data in achieving the task. We then define\na rate\u2013utility function:\nR(U) = min\np(\u02c6x|x):E[u(X,\u02c6X)]\u2265UI(X;\u02c6X), (37)\nwhich reflects the minimal rate required to ensure expected\nutility U. This formulation aligns naturally with semantic\nsufficiency and relevance criteria.\n2) Indirect semantic rate-distortion for intrinsic-extrinsic\nsource models\nA different extension to classical rate-distortion theory\naddresses scenarios where the semantic state is not directly\nobservable, but only indirectly inferred through noisy obser-\nvations [51]\u2013[54]. In [51], [52], the authors propose a two-\ntier source model comprising an intrinsic (semantic) state S\nrepresenting the true meaning or latent feature of the source\nand an extrinsic observation X, which is stochastically\nrelated to Svia a known conditional distribution p(x|s). The\nencoder observes only X, and the goal is to compress it into\na codeword that allows ( i) reconstruction \u02c6Sof the intrinsic\nstate, and ( ii) reproduction \u02c6Xof the observation itself; see\nFigure 2.\nintrinsic state process\u00a0 extrinsic observation process\u00a0\nEncoder\nDecoder\nFIGURE 2. Illustration of a semantic source and its lossy compression\n(redrawn from [52]).\nDistortion metrics ds\u0000\ns,\u02c6s\u0001\nanddx\u0000\nx,\u02c6x\u0001\nmeasure the fi-\ndelity of the semantic reconstruction and the syntactic fidelity\nof the extrinsic signal, respectively. The joint rate-distortion\nproblem is stated as:\nProblem 2:\nR(Ds, Dx) = min\np(\u02c6s,\u02c6x|x)I(X;\u02c6S,\u02c6X) (38a)\ns.t.E\u0002\nds(S,\u02c6S)\u0003\n\u2264Ds, (38b)\nE\u0002\ndx(X,\u02c6X)\u0003\n\u2264Dx. (38c)\nHere, DsandDxare the allowable semantic and extrinsic\ndistortions, and I(X;\u02c6S,\u02c6X)quantifies the required encoding\nrate. Since Sis not observed directly, this is an instance\nof the indirect (or remote) rate-distortion problem [24].\nThe decoder jointly reconstructs (\u02c6S,\u02c6X)based solely on the\ncompressed \u02c6X.Focusing on a tractable yet revealing example, the paper\nassumes:\nX=AS+W, (39)\nwhere SandWare zero-mean Gaussian random vectors,\ni.e.,S\u223c N (0,\u03a3S),W\u223c N (0,\u03a3W), and Ais a known\nmatrix. Distortions are quadratic, i.e., ds(s,\u02c6s) =\u2225s\u2212\u02c6s\u22252\nanddx(x,\u02c6x) =\u2225x\u2212\u02c6x\u22252. Under these conditions, the rate-\ndistortion problem reduces to a convex optimization over the\nerror covariance matrix of \u02c6S. Specifically, one minimizes\nthe mutual information I(X;\u02c6S,\u02c6X)subject to covariance\nconstraints linked to DsandDx. When \u03a3S,\u03a3W, and Aare\nsimultaneously diagonalizable, the optimal solution admits\nawater-filling structure, allocating bit-rate to dimensions\naccording to their signal-to-noise and semantic importance.\nBuilding on the semantic source model discussed above,\nwhere the communication goal is to preserve task-relevant\ninformation about an intrinsic semantic state, another sig-\nnificant extension is offered in [53], which adapts the SDR\nparadigm to discrete, finite-alphabet settings , motivated by\nrobust and task-aligned communication for symbolic or log-\nical data (e.g., decisions, classifications, or control actions).\nWith a structure similar to the Gaussian model above,\nthe authors in [53] formulated the general rate-distortion\nproblem as follows.\nProblem 3:\nR(Ds, Dx) = min\np(u|x), \u03d5(u), \u03c8(u)I(X;U) (40a)\ns.t.E[ds(S, \u03d5(U))]\u2264Ds (40b)\nE[dx(X, \u03c8(U))]\u2264Dx. (40c)\nHere, \u03d5and\u03c8are decoders for semantic and syntactic\nreconstructions, respectively.\nTo provide analytical insights, [53] presents detailed solu-\ntions for the case of binary source and goal variables under\nstandard distortion metrics; namely:\n\u2022Case 1: Binary source and semantic variables un-\nder Hamming distortions. A closed-form expression for\nR(Ds, Dx)is derived using convexity and symmetry\narguments.\n\u2022Case 2: Binary variables with Hamming and erasure\ndistortion. This illustrates how the choice of distortion\naffects achievable rates, emphasizing that semantic fidelity\ndepends not only on joint distributions but also on the\noperational meaning of distortion.\nA major conclusion from this study is that the nature\nof the distortion constraint critically shapes the encoding\nstrategy . For example, when erasure distortion is allowed, the\nencoder may choose to remain silent under high uncertainty,\nthereby improving average semantic fidelity under limited\nbandwidth. This aligns with broader trends in goal-oriented\ncommunication: not all bits are equally valuable, and the\nvalue of information depends on context and task.\nVOLUME , 11\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nTogether with the Gaussian analysis of indirect SDR, this\nwork completes the picture by offering a rigorous, finite-\nalphabet formulation with operational relevance to digital\nsystems. It supports the design of practical encoding schemes\nfor real-world deployments, where semantic variables are not\nobserved directly, channel rates are constrained, and multiple\nfidelity objectives must be satisfied concurrently. This SDR\nmodel highlights key principles: latent semantic states can\nbe integrated into source models; multiple distortion metrics\ncan be managed jointly; and optimal encoding requires\nbalancing both semantic and extrinsic goals. Extensions of\nthis framework can be invaluable in designing goal-oriented\ncommunication for multi-agent systems and semantic-aware\ncontrol architectures.\n3) Implications of semantic rate distortion for MASs\nIn MASs, SDR offers a theoretical foundation for de-\nsigning goal-oriented and resource-aware communication\npolicies. Agents can learn to encode and transmit only\ninformation that is causally or statistically relevant to shared\nobjectives, such as cooperative localization, distributed map-\nping, or team-based control. This is particularly valuable in\nbandwidth-constrained and decentralized settings, where ex-\ncessive communication may lead to congestion, energy drain,\nor poor scalability [48]. Furthermore, agents may adapt their\ncompression behavior dynamically, depending on context or\nuncertainty. For instance, in high-stakes or high-uncertainty\nregions of the task space, agents can increase communication\nfidelity, while in stable or low-impact settings, they can\nreduce or suppress transmission altogether. These context-\nsensitive behaviors align with the SDR paradigm. It is\ndeduced that SDR facilitates the emergence of intelligent\ncommunication protocols that optimize not for data preser-\nvation, but for decision utility, advancing the vision of multi-\nagent systems that communicate with purpose.\nC. Semantic information theory and G theory\nA key innovation in Lu\u2019s semantic information theory , or\nG theory [55], lies in redefining the notion of information\nthrough a semantic lens. Rather than relying solely on Shan-\nnon\u2019s probabilistic framework, which quantifies information\nas the reduction in uncertainty about a source variable, G\ntheory proposes measuring the semantic alignment between\nmessages and the real-world states they describe. This is\nespecially useful in contexts such as human-robot interaction\nand cooperative multi-agent systems, where communication\nis not only about statistical inference but also about convey-\ning and interpreting the significance of the information.\nAt the heart of G theory is the truth function , denoted\nT\u03b8(y|x), which measures the semantic compatibility between\na message yand a source state x, as perceived by a\nreceiver with interpretation model \u03b8. Here, \u03b8parametrizes\nthe receiver\u2019s internal semantic model, allowing for non-\nsymmetric interpretations of messages across different re-\nceivers or tasks. Based on this framework, the semanticdistortion is defined as:\nd(y|x) =\u2212logT\u03b8(y|x), (41)\nwhich penalizes semantic mismatch between the message\nand the ground truth. The greater the semantic misalignment,\nthe higher the distortion. Building upon this, G theory defines\nthesemantic mutual information between the source variable\nXand the interpreted message Y\u03b8as:\nI(X;Y\u03b8) =X\nx,yp(x, y) logT\u03b8(y|x)\nT\u03b8(y), (42)\nwhere\nT\u03b8(y) =X\nxp(x)T\u03b8(y|x) (43)\nis the marginal semantic alignment of the message yover\nthe distribution of possible source states. This formulation\ncaptures the semantic contribution of a message to the\nreceiver\u2019s understanding of the world. Specifically, it quanti-\nfies how much the message yhelps the receiver, modeled\nby\u03b8, improve its belief about the true state x, not in\nterms of probabilistic prediction but in terms of semantic\ncorrectness. Notably, this measure is generally asymmetric ,\ni.e.,I(X;Y\u03b8)\u0338=I(Y\u03b8;X), reflecting the asymmetry of\ninterpretation inherent to communication with semantics.\nUnlike Shannon\u2019s mutual information I(X;Y), which is\nbounded by the channel capacity and independent of task or\ncontext, the semantic mutual information I(X;Y\u03b8)directly\ndepends on the receiver\u2019s interpretive model \u03b8. This opens\nthe door to goal- and context-dependent communication\nsystems where the significance/relevance of a message is\njudged by its utility to the recipient.\nD. Toward a unified framework: integrating theoretical\nmodels\nThe development of goal-oriented communication has\ndrawn from multiple theoretical traditions, each offering\nunique strengths. However, these models often appear dis-\njoint in formulation and application. Herein, we discuss\nhow foundational models (namely, the IB principle, SDR\ntheory, and G theory) can be conceptually integrated into a\nunified framework. At the core of all three approaches is\nthe idea that communication should serve a purpose , such\nas improving task performance, reducing uncertainty about\nrelevant variables, or aligning interpretations. Each model\nformalizes this idea differently:\n\u2022IB frames the trade-off between compressing raw obser-\nvations and retaining task-relevant content. It is especially\nsuited for learning agent representations under uncertainty\nand bandwidth constraints. This is often achieved through\nvariational inference or neural encoders.\n\u2022SDR generalizes classical rate-distortion theory by replac-\ning syntactic error measures with task-aware or utility-\ndriven metrics. It enables communication that focuses on\ndecision utility rather than full-state reconstruction. More\nspecifically, communication channels are evaluated based\n12 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 13 ---\non how well compressed representations support specific\ndecision outcomes, such as control accuracy, detection\nrate, or reward maximization. This leads to problem-\nspecific distortion or utility functions.\n\u2022G Theory redefines information through semantic align-\nment between messages and states. Beyond task metrics,\nthe meaning of a message is modeled explicitly via\ntruth functions T\u03b8(y|x)that reflect semantic compatibility.\nIt accounts for interpretation asymmetry and receiver-\nspecific beliefs, making it suitable for scenarios involving\nheterogeneity, abstraction, or symbolic reasoning.\nEssentially, these approaches are not mutually exclusive. For\nexample, in the broader landscape of goal-oriented communi-\ncation, G theory provides a complement to task-based rate-\ndistortion approaches. Whereas task-oriented models such\nas the one in [52] formulate the problem through classical\ninformation-theoretic lenses by defining distortions in terms\nof task accuracy or utility (e.g., control error, estimation\nloss), G theory further generalizes this idea by redefining\ninformation and distortion in terms of semantics, thus offer-\ning a semantic abstraction by evaluating messages through\nshared truth models. When task distortion functions are in-\nterpreted through semantic alignment or truth functions, both\nparadigms can be unified under a more general framework\nforgoal-oriented communication .\nIt is envisioned that such methods will be integrated and\ngoal-oriented communication will be treated as a multi-layer\noptimization. For example, a message may be produced via\nan IB encoder, optimized via a semantic rate distortion utility\nobjective, and evaluated semantically via a G-theoretic truth\nfunction. In the realm of MASs, each agent may adapt\nits messaging behavior based on local context, the task\nat hand, and the semantic expectations of its neighboring\nagents. Such a unified perspective can guide the design of\npractical architectures that combine representation learning,\nrate-aware communication, and semantic reasoning, enabling\nMASs that are not only efficient and distributed\u2014but also\ninterpretable, adaptive, and aligned with mission goals.\nE. Distributed information-theoretic goal-oriented com-\nmunication in MASs\nThe theoretical foundations laid by the IB principle pro-\nvide a powerful tool for designing MASs, in which each\nagent may observe high-dimensional, noisy data and must\ncompress its observations into low-bandwidth messages. The\nIB objective offers a way to learn representations that retain\nonly information relevant to a shared decision variable (e.g.,\nthe global reward or consensus), allowing agents to com-\nmunicate concisely yet effectively. By minimizing I(X;T)\nwhile maximizing I(T;Y), agents discard nuisance factors\nwhile preserving task-critical content. Variational extensions,\nsuch as the deep VIB framework, make such representations\nlearnable via gradient-based optimization. Thus, in order to\nenable scalable learning of communication policies even insuch MAS environments, distributed learning methods can\nbe invoked.\nSDR theory offers a complementary perspective by re-\ndefining distortion not in terms of reconstruction fidelity, but\nin terms of the effectiveness of the transmitted message in\nsupporting a goal. In distributed MAS settings, this leads to\ncommunication protocols that minimize rate while guaran-\nteeing acceptable levels of task performance. For instance,\nagents can use goal-oriented distortion metrics such as\nclassification error, control deviation, or belief inconsistency,\nrather than raw signal deviation. When semantic represen-\ntations are latent or indirectly observed, recent advances in\nindirect SDR provide optimization formulations that jointly\nminimize the rate needed to support both semantic accuracy\nand syntactic fidelity.\nRate-utility formulations are particularly useful in hetero-\ngeneous MASs, where agents may possess different sensing\nmodalities or decision roles, and thus require asymmetric\nor adaptive communication strategies. For example, one\nagent may prioritize transmission of localization cues while\nanother may share semantic object descriptors. Goal-oriented\nutility metrics allow for such diversity while maintaining\ncoordination efficiency.\nGoing further, Lu\u2019s G theory adds a semantic abstraction\nlayer by replacing task-based distortion metrics with truth\nfunctions that model semantic alignment between messages\nand the world. The concept of semantic mutual information ,\nI(X;Y\u03b8), introduces an information measure that accounts\nfor interpretability and meaning from the perspective of the\nreceiver. This is especially relevant in human-agent or robot-\nrobot interaction scenarios where message interpretation may\ndiffer between entities. G theory thus enables the design of\nagents that not only learn what to communicate but also\nhow their messages will be interpreted, potentially adjusting\nmessages for different agents or roles in a task.\nThese approaches are especially valuable in real-world\napplications like robot teams, distributed sensing, and collab-\norative decision-making, where communication must be both\nefficient and aligned with shared goals. Looking ahead, these\nideas can be extended to handle large teams, time-varying\ntasks, and complex reasoning by incorporating hierarchical\nstructures, memory over time, and causal understanding,\npaving the way for scalable, intelligent, and goal-driven\ncommunication.\nIV. Coordination of WNCSs under Communication\nConstraints\nA central challenge in designing and benchmarking goal-\noriented communication systems is selecting appropriate\nmetrics that reflect both communication efficiency and\ntask effectiveness. Unlike traditional communication systems\nwhere metrics like throughput or bit error rate suffice,\nin MASs, coordination is essential for achieving shared\ngoals. However, this coordination is increasingly constrained\nby communication limitations, such as limited bandwidth,\nVOLUME , 13\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nenergy constraints, and latency. In goal-oriented MASs,\nagents must strike a balance between communication cost\nand coordination accuracy. Achieving effective coordination\nunder such conditions requires intelligent decision-making\nregarding when, what, and with whom to communicate. To\nexplore these trade-offs, we focus on estimation and control\nproblems in the context of WNCSs. A MAS may consist of\nmultiple WNCSs, either independent or coupled, potentially\nsharing a common wireless network. This shared medium\nintroduces contention, interference, and scheduling complex-\nity\u2014making communication-aware coordination even more\ncritical.\nTo ground our discussion of goal-oriented communica-\ntion metrics, we first present a representative model of a\nMAS consisting of multiple WNCSs. Using this model as\na foundation, we introduce and analyze key metrics that\nquantify the importance/significance of information for com-\nmunication scheduling and control performance. Therefore,\nwe extend the system presented in Section B to account of\na MAS consisting of multiple WNCSs. For simplicity of\nexposition, we consider the case for which the dynamics are\ndecoupled, as depicted in Figure 3.\nSystem 1 System N\nFIGURE 3. Example of a MAS layout where NWNCSs that exchange no\nexplicit information compete to access channel j\u2208 M . Each subsystem\ni\u2208 N consists of a plant ( Pi), sensor ( Si), controller ( Ci), and the\nchannel access decisions are determined by Tiwhich is embedded in the\nsensor block.\nEach plant Piis modeled by the following LTI difference\nequation\nxi,k+1=Aixi,k+Biui,k+wi,k, (44)\nwhere xi,k\u2208Rniandui,k\u2208Rmiare the states and inputs\nof subsystem iat time step k, respectively. The system and\ninput matrices are denoted by AiandBi, respectively, and\nwe assume that \u03c3max(Ai)>1for all i. The initial state xi,0\nis a Gaussian random variable with mean \u00afxi,0and covariance\nXi,0and the process disturbance wi,kis zero-mean Gaussian\nwith covariance Wi. The measurement taken by the sensor\nSiatkis given by\nyi,k=Cixi,k+vi,k, (45)\nwhere Ci\u2208Rpi\u00d7niis the output matrix and vi,kis zero-\nmean Gaussian with covariance Vi. We assume the vi,k,wi,kandxi,0are mutually independent. The sensor has access to\nthe past control inputs and the entire measurement history\nwhich is utilized to determine the a posteriori state estimate\nby running the following local Kalman filter\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k= \u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121+Ki(yi,k\u2212Ci\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121), (46a)\n\u02c6xs\ni,k+1|k=Ai\u02c6xs\ni,k|k+Biui,k, (46b)\nwhere\nKi=hi(\u00afPi)CT\ni(Cihi(\u00afPi)CT\ni+Vi)\u22121, (47)\nis the steady-state filter gain, hi(\u00b7)is the Lyapunov-like\nfunction defined as h(X)\u225cAXAT+Wand \u00afPiis the\nsteady-state a posteriori error covariance.\n1) Shared communication resources\nThe wireless network consists of M(|M|=M) wireless\nchannels and the bandwidth limitation is such that M <\nN. The decision variable \u03b4i,j,k\u2208 {0,1}represents whether\nsubsystem itransmits on channel jin frame kas follows.\n\u03b4i,j,k=(\n1,Sitransmits \u02c6xs\ni,k|kon channel jtoCi,\n0,otherwise .(48)\nWe assume that instantaneous packet acknowledgements-\n/negative-acknowledgements (ACK/NACKs) are available\nthrough an error-free feedback channel and define\n\u03b3i,j,k=(\n1,if\u03b4i,j,k=1and packet successfully received ,\n0,otherwise .\n(49)\nWe consider the case in which P{\u03b3i,j,k= 1|\u03b4i,j,k= 1} \u22641\nas opposed to the case of reliable channels where P{\u03b3i,j,k=\n1|\u03b4i,j,k= 1}= 1. For clarity of exposition, we assume\nmemoryless wireless channels, corresponding to multipath-\ndominated environments where channel gain variations are\nuncorrelated across time and space. This assumption is\nwidely adopted in the design and analysis of WNCSs [26],\n[32], [56], [57]. In this setting, packet dropouts are modeled\nas a Bernoulli process with a fixed success probability\n\u00afqi,j\u2208(0,1]. Specifically, the probability of a successful\ntransmission from agent ito agent jat time k, conditioned\non a channel access attempt, is given by:\nP{\u03b3i,j,k= 1|\u03b4i,j,k= 1}= \u00afqi,j. (50)\nAdditionally, we let\n\u03b8i,k=(\n1,ifPM\nj=1\u03b3i,j,k= 1,\n0,otherwise ,(51)\nrepresent whether Cireceives a data packet at k. Conse-\nquently, the time elapsed since the last successful packet\nreception at Ciis given by\nti,k= min {\u03ba\u22650 :\u03b8i,k\u2212\u03ba= 1}. (52)\nWe consider a communication model where each frame\nconsists of a single time-slot, and channel access decisions\nmust adhere to certain constraints. In particular, to avoid\n14 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 15 ---\ninterference and ensure collision-free transmissions, the fol-\nlowing condition is imposed.\nNX\ni=1\u03b4i,j,k\u22641,\u2200j\u2208 M,\u2200k\u2208Z\u22650. (53)\nSecond, we assume no diversity scheme is used and that\neach sensor may only occupy one channel at a time, i.e.,\nMX\nj=1\u03b4i,j,k\u22641,\u2200i\u2208 N,\u2200k\u2208Z\u22650. (54)\n2) Control and estimation\nThe objective of the controller design is to minimize the\nstandard quadratic cost of the entire system which is given\nby\nJ0:\u221e= lim\nK\u2192\u221e1\nKE(K\u22121X\nk=0NX\ni=1\u0000\nxT\ni,kQixi,k+uT\ni,kRiui,k\u0001)\n,\n(55)\nwhere QiandRiare positive semi-definite and positive\ndefinite weighting matrices of appropriate dimensions, re-\nspectively. We assume that the pairs (Ai, Bi)and(Ai, Q1/2\ni)\nare controllable and observable, respectively. The channel\naccess schemes proposed in the subsequent sections result\nin the independence of channel access decisions and past\ncontrol actions. Therefore, the certainty equivalence principle\nholds and the optimal controller is\nui,k=Li,\u221e\u02c6xk|k, (56)\nwhere Li,\u221eis the optimal feedback gain given by\nLi,\u221e=\u2212(BT\ni\u03a0i,\u221eBi+Ri)\u22121BT\ni\u03a0i,\u221eAi, (57)\nand\u03a0i,\u221eis the unique positive semi-definite solution of the\nfollowing DARE\n\u03a0i,\u221e=AT\ni\u03a0i,\u221eAi+Qi\u2212LT\ni,\u221e(BT\ni\u03a0i,\u221eBi+Ri)Li,\u221e.\n(58)\nMoreover, \u02c6xi,k|k\u225cE{xi,k|Ic\ni,k}is the state estimate calcu-\nlated by the controller. To describe Ic\ni,k, we first discuss the\ninformation available at Si. At the beginning of k, the sensor\nis aware of the latest measurement and the entire history of\npast measurements, control inputs, channel access decisions\non all channels, and their outcome, i.e.,\nIs\ni,k={yk\ni,uk\u22121\ni,\u03b4k\u22121\ni,1,\u03b3k\u22121\ni,1, . . . ,\u03b4k\u22121\ni,M,\u03b3k\u22121\ni,M},(59)\nwhere we use bold face to denote a sequence of variables\nsuch as\n\u03b4k\u22121\ni,j={\u03b4i,j,0, \u03b4i,j,1, . . . , \u03b4 i,j,k\u22121}.\nRecall that the data packet contains the sensor\u2019s state esti-\nmate and thus a successful transmission at kprovides \u02c6xs\ni,k|k\nto the controller. Therefore, the information available at the\ncontroller is given by\nIc\ni,k={\u03b8k\ni\u2299\u02c6xsk\ni,uk\u22121\ni,\u03b4k\ni,1,\u03b3k\ni,1, . . . ,\u03b4k\ni,M,\u03b3k\ni,M},(60)where \u03b8k\niis inferred from the ACK/NACK history and \u2299\ndenotes the Hadamard product. Based on this information,\nthe state estimate and error covariance at the controller are\nobtained by\n\u02c6xi,k|k= (Ai+BiLi,\u221e)ti,k\u02c6xs\ni,k\u2212tk|k\u2212ti,k, (61)\nPi,k|k=hti,k(\u00afPi), (62)\nwhere h0\ni(X)\u225cXandti,kis given in (52).\nRecall that the information available to sensor iat the\nbeginning of transmission frame kis given in (59). Note that\nknowledge of the past channel access decisions is sufficient\nto infer the past control actions without requiring explicit\ncommunication from the controller. Define\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121\u225cE{xk|Is\ni,k\u22121}, (63)\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u225cE{xk|Is\ni,k}, (64)\nas the a priori anda posteriori state estimates at the sensor,\nrespectively, with the respective error covariances defined as\nPs\ni,k|k\u22121\u225cE{(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121)(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121)T|Is\ni,k\u22121},\nPs\ni,k|k\u225cE{(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xs\ni,k|k)(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xs\ni,k|k)T|Is\ni,k}.\nBy running a local Kalman filter, the sensor can calculate\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|krecursively. Let functions h, g:Sn\n+\u2192Sn\n+be defined\nas\nh(X)\u225cAXAT+W, (65)\ng(X)\u225cX\u2212XCT(CXCT+V)\u22121CX. (66)\nThe recursive Kalman filtering equations for sensor iare\ngiven by\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k= \u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121+Ki,k(yi,k\u2212Ci\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121), (67a)\n\u02c6xs\ni,k+1|k=Ai\u02c6xs\ni,k|k+Biui,k, (67b)\nPs\ni,k|k=g\u25e6h(Ps\ni,k\u22121|k\u22121), (67c)\nPs\ni,k+1|k=h(Ps\ni,k|k), (67d)\nKi,k+1=Ps\ni,k+1|kCT\ni(CiPs\ni,k+1|kCT\ni+Vi)\u22121,(67e)\nwhere g\u25e6h(\u00b7)\u225cg(h(\u00b7))denotes the function composition\nand the initial conditions are \u02c6xs\ni,0|\u22121= 0andPs\ni,0|\u22121=Xi,0.\nSince the measurements are available uninterruptedly at the\nsensor, the error covariance converges exponentially fast\n[33]. Based on the assumption that the pairs (Ai, Ci)and\n(Ai, W1/2\ni)are observable and controllable, respectively,\ng\u25e6h(X) =Xhas a unique positive semi-definite solution\nwhich we denote by \u00afP[33]. In what follows, for simplicity of\nexposition, we will assume that the filter has already entered\nsteady state and Ps\ni,k|k=\u00afPifor all k, which is a common\nassumption in similar settings [34]\u2013[39]. As a result, the\nfiltering equations can be simplified as\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k= \u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121+Ki(yi,k\u2212Ci\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u22121), (68a)\n\u02c6xs\ni,k+1|k=Ai\u02c6xs\ni,k|k+Biui,k, (68b)\nwhere the time-invariant Kalman filter gain is given by\nKi=h(\u00afPi)CT\ni(Cih(\u00afPi)CT\ni+Vi)\u22121. (69)\nVOLUME , 15\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nIf channel access is granted k, the sensor transmits a\ndata packet which contains \u02c6xs\ni,k|kin (68a) which conveys\ninformation about the missing measurements to the the\ncontroller, i.e., {yi,k\u2212tk\u22121+1, . . . , y i,k}[40]. Consequently,\nthe information available at the controller is given by\nIc\ni,k={yi,k\u2212tk,ui,k\u22121,\u03b4i,k}and its state estimate and the\ncorresponding error covariance become\n\u02c6xi,k|k= (Ai+BiLi,\u221e)tk\u02c6xs\ni,k\u2212tk|k\u2212tk, (70)\nPi,k|k=htk(\u00afPi), (71)\nwhere h0(X)\u225cX.\nA. Metrics for Information Importance/Significance in\nWNCSs and relevant optimization problems\nThe cost should be defined in a way that it can be\nevaluated based on the local information of each decision-\nmaker, i.e., Ic\ni,k\u22121. Using the law of total expectation, (55)\ncan be written as\nJ0:\u221e= lim\nK\u2192\u221e1\nKE(K\u22121X\nk=0NX\ni=1E\b\nJi,k|Ic\ni,k\t)\n+NX\ni=1tr(\u03a0 i,\u221eWi), (72)\nwhere\nJi,k\u225ctr\u0000\n\u0393i,\u221e(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xi,k|k)(xi,k\u2212\u02c6xi,k|k)T\u0001\n. (73)\nTo illustrate the intuition behind prioritized channel access\nand derive the priority measures, we begin by letting Fk\u225c\n{i:i\u2208 N, \u03b4i,k= 1}denote the subset of subsystems that\ntransmit at kand define \u00afFk\u225cN \\F k. Moreover, we denote\nthe cost incurred by subsystem iatkbyJi,k. The cost of\nthe entire system at kcan be written as in (74). Recall that\nI\u03c4\ni,kdenotes the information available to Scheduler block and\nour only assumption so far is that Ic\ni,k\u22121\u2286 I\u03c4\ni,k. The last\nequality in (74) reveals that the channel access decisions at\nkonly influence the last summation. Furthermore, due to the\nlack of constraints on energy consumption, any transmission\nis always preferred. As a result, minimizing the cost of the\nentire system at ksubject to (53) and (54) is equivalent to\nFk= arg max\ni\u2208Nmi,k, (75)\nwhere\nmi,k=X\ni\u2208NE\b\nJi,k|I\u03c4\ni,k, \u03b8i,k= 0\t\n\u2212X\ni\u2208Fk\u0010\nE\b\nJi,k|I\u03c4\ni,k, \u03b8i,k= 0\t\n\u2212E\b\nJi,k|I\u03c4\ni,k, \u03b8i,k= 1\t\u0011\n\u00afqi,j. (76)\ndenotes the priority measure. The impact of the choice of\nJi,kandI\u03c4\ni,kon the resulting priority measure are discussed\nnext.1) Cost of information loss (CoIL)\nThe term Cost of Information Loss (CoIL) was introduced\nin [58] to quantify the performance degradation caused by\nmissing information in networked control systems. A key\nproperty of CoIL is that it depends on the statistical prop-\nerties, such as the variance of the process and measurement\nnoise, rather than the actual sensor readings. This enables\npreemptive scheduling decisions to be made at the controller\nside without requiring real-time measurements, significantly\nreducing communication overhead in centralized systems.\nIn distributed scenarios, CoIL can still be computed based\nsolely on timing information, which allows control units\nto prioritize channel access independently of the sensor\u2019s\ncomputational capacity. This makes CoIL particularly at-\ntractive for systems with low-cost or passive sensors. Such\narchitectures motivate variance-based triggering laws (e.g.,\n[35], [59]) and enable controller-side negotiation of access\npriorities, as further developed in follow-up works [60], [61].\nWithin this metric, we solve the following problem on a\nsingle-step horizon, i.e.,\nProblem 4:\nmin\n\u2206kX\ni\u2208NE\b\nJi,k|Ic\ni,k\t\n,\ns. t.

In case a sensor is not granted channel access, i.e.,\ni\u2208\u00afFk, then certainly \u03b8i,k= 0.

In its foundational\ntreatment, V oI was defined as the expected increase in\nutility obtained by reducing uncertainty prior to selecting\nan action. This notion has since been adopted across di-\nverse disciplines. In information economics, V oI captures the\neconomic worth of information in markets and mechanism-\ndesign frameworks, linking information asymmetry to deci-\nsion efficiency [63]. In risk management, V oI has informed\ndecisions about investing in information gathering for un-\ncertain systems and environments [64]. In shortest path\noptimization, V oI is used to determine whether acquiring\nadditional data (e.g., traffic or environmental conditions)\njustifies the computational or communication cost, as in [65].\nIn the context of networked control systems, a specific\nvariant of V oI is adopted in [66], [67]. The main distin-\nguishing feature of this variant of V oI is that the actual\nmeasurements are taken into consideration for evaluating\nit. To be more specific, instead of using the information\navailable at the controller for priority assignment as in\nCoIL, V oI utilizes the sensor\u2019s information, i.e., I\u03c4\ni,k=Is\ni,k.Subsequently, we define\nVoIi,k\u225cE\b\nJi,k|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k= 0\t\n\u2212E\b\nJi,k|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k= 1\t\n,\n(82)\nwhere Ji,kis defined as (73). Let es\ni,k|k\u225cxi,k\u2212\u02c6xs\ni,k|kand\n\u02c7ei,k|k\u225c\u02c6xs\ni,k|k\u2212\u02c6xi,k|k. Since\nei,k|k=xi,k\u2212\u02c6xi,k|k=es\ni,k|k+ \u02c7ei,k|k,\nwe can write\nE{Ji,k|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k=0}\n= tr(\u0393 i,\u221eE{(es\ni,k|k+ \u02c7ei,k|k)(es\ni,k|k+ \u02c7ei,k|k)T|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k=0}\n= tr(\u0393 i,\u221eE{es\ni,k|kes\ni,k|kT|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k=0})+tr(\u0393 i,\u221e\u02c7ei,k|k\u02c7eT\ni,k|k)\n= tr(\u0393 i,\u221e\u00afPi) + tr(\u0393 i,\u221e\u02c7ei,k|k\u02c7eT\ni,k|k), (83)\nwhere the second equality follows from the facts that\nE{es\ni,k|k|Is\ni,k, \u03b4i,k=0}= 0 and\u02c7ei,k|kis deterministically\ngiven by\n\u02c7ei,k|k=kX\n\u02c7t=k\u2212ti,k\u22121+1Ak\u2212\u02c7t\niKi(yi,\u02c7t\u2212Ci\u02c6xs\n\u02c7t|\u02c7t\u22121), (84)\nwhere Kiin this case is the invariant Kalman gain in (69).\nFurthermore, absence of packet dropouts means that \u02c6xi,k|k=\n\u02c6xs\ni,k|k. Therefore, by following the same steps as in (83) we\nobtain\nE{Ji,k|Is\ni,k, \u03b8i,k=1}= tr(\u0393 i,\u221e\u00afPi). (85)\nFinally, substituting (83) and (85) in (82) yields\nVoIi,k= tr(\u0393 i,\u221e\u02c7ei,k|k\u02c7eT\ni,k|k). (86)\nA key limitation of employing V oI as the priority metric\nin (75) is that its implementation typically requires smart\nsensors with sufficient computational capabilities. However,\nsince V oI incorporates more information than CoIL in its\ncomputation, it is generally expected to yield improved\nperformance, as supported by empirical results in [68] and\n[69]. This holds true even though CoIL-based scheduling\nhas been shown to result in lower estimation error covari-\nance at the controller, as reported in [70]. An illustrative\nexample demonstrating how adopting each priority measure\ninfluences the channel access decisions and performance is\nprovided in [71, Example 3.3.1].\n3) Age of Information (AoI)\nAge of Information (AoI) [72]\u2013[75] is a performance met-\nric that quantifies the timeliness or freshness of information\nVOLUME , 17\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nin communication systems. Unlike traditional metrics such as\nlatency or throughput, which measure packet delivery delay\nor volume, AoI captures the age of the most fresh received\nupdate at a decision-maker. Formally, at any time t, the AoI\nis defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the\nmost fresh successfully received status update, i.e.,\n\u2206(t) =t\u2212u(t),\nwhere u(t)denotes the generation time of the most fresh\nreceived packet by time t.\nOriginally introduced to address the demands of real-\ntime status monitoring, AoI has become a critical metric\nin systems where the significance of information diminishes\nover time. Intuitively understood as a measure of information\nfreshness , AoI was designed to capture strict timeliness\nrequirements in machine-type communications, including in-\ntelligent transportation systems, industrial Internet of Things\n(IIoT), and other ultra-reliable low-latency (URLLC) appli-\ncations. In such environments, ensuring that the receiver\nhas access to the most recent data is often more important\nthan maximizing data throughput or minimizing the delay.\nThe primary appeal of AoI lies in its ability to capture\nthe temporal relevance of information. Traditional latency\nmetrics only account for individual packet delays, whereas\nAoI reflects how stale the receiver\u2019s view of the system is.\nThis makes AoI particularly well-suited for systems with\ntight feedback loops, where outdated data can lead to poor\ncontrol decisions or system instability. The introduction of\nAoI has led to the development of a rich body of the-\noretical and applied research. Among the topics explored\nare sampling and scheduling policies designed to minimize\nAoI under bandwidth and energy constraints, the analysis of\nAoI dynamics in queuing systems and wireless multi-access\nnetworks, and the design of medium access control (MAC)\nprotocols that are explicitly AoI-aware. More recently, AoI\nhas been adapted to more specialized forms. Two key AoI-\nbased performance measures have been extensively studied:\n1)Average AoI (AAoI) : the long-term time average of the\nAoI process,\n\u00af\u2206 = lim\nT\u2192\u221e1\nTZT\n0\u2206(t)dt, (87)\nwhich can also be computed as the ratio of the ex-\npected area under the AoI curve Qnto the expected\ninter-update duration Yn[73]:\n\u00af\u2206 =E[Qn]\nE[Yn]. (88)\n2)Peak AoI (PAoI) : the age value just before a new update\nis received. If Andenotes the age just before the n-th\nupdate arrives, then the long-run average peak age is\n\u2206(p)= lim\nN\u2192\u221e1\nNNX\nn=1An\n=E[An] =E[Yn] +E[Tn], (89)where Tnis the random delay associated with deliver-\ning the n-th packet [73].\nThe success of AoI has spawned numerous extensions and\nvariants tailored to specific application requirements. Notable\ndevelopments include Age of Synchronization (AoS), which\nmeasures temporal misalignment between distributed nodes,\nand Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), which accounts for\nboth the duration and magnitude of estimation errors. Recent\ninnovations have extended AoI beyond traditional timeli-\nness considerations to encompass the complete information\nlifecycle. The concept of Age of Actuation , introduced in\n[76], focuses on the timeliness of control actions rather\nthan merely information reception. Building upon this foun-\ndation, Age of Actuated Information [77] provides a more\ncomprehensive framework that considers both the timeliness\nof information generation and its subsequent utilization in\ndecision-making processes. These metrics recognize that in\nmany systems, the ultimate value of information lies not\nin its reception but in its effective translation into timely\nactions.\nIn the context of multi-agent systems and goal-oriented\ncommunication, AoI serves as both a foundational metric\nand a building block for more sophisticated information\nvaluation frameworks. While AoI provides essential insights\ninto information freshness, intelligent agents operating in\ncomplex environments require additional criteria to deter-\nmine not only whether information is fresh, but also whether\nit is worth communicating given its expected contribution to\ntask performance and coordination objectives. This evolution\nhas led to the development of hybrid metrics that combine\nAoI with task-relevance measures and semantic importance\nindicators. In such systems, communication decisions are\ndriven by multi-objective optimization problems that balance\ninformation freshness against communication costs, energy\nconsumption, and task performance requirements; see, for\nexample, [78]. The integration of AoI with goal-oriented\nframeworks enables the design of intelligent communication\nprotocols that can adaptively prioritize updates based on their\ntemporal relevance and decision-making impact [26], [45],\n[79]\u2013[81].\nB. Goal-oriented communications for heterogeneous\nspatially-distributed MASs\nAs multi-agent systems scale to hundreds or thousands\nof agents, such as in swarm robotics, sensor networks, and\ndistributed AI, the efficiency of communication becomes\nincreasingly critical. In such systems, centralized scheduling\nand naive all-to-all communication quickly become infeasi-\nble due to congestion, delay, and energy limitations. There-\nfore, mechanisms, such as scheduling, routing, and prior-\nitization, must be carefully designed to allocate bandwidth\nand attention to the most task-relevant agents, messages, and\nlocations. This section discusses key strategies to address\nthese challenges, focusing on role-aware ,spatially-aware ,\nandgraph-structured communication paradigms.\n18 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n1) Role-based and spatially-aware communication\nIn cooperative MASs, agents often assume distinct roles\nor operate in spatial sub-regions of the environment. These\nroles may be predefined, such as sensor, relay, or decision-\nmaker, or may emerge dynamically through task require-\nments, for instance in leader-follower coordination or ex-\nploration\u2013exploitation patterns. Role-based communication\nleverages these structures by prioritizing transmissions from\nagents whose information is deemed most critical to global\ntask performance. For example, in multi-robot exploration\nscenarios, certain agents may be assigned temporary relay\nroles to preserve network connectivity, while others fo-\ncus on sensing or actuation. One such implementation is\nthe Connectivity-Aware Relay Algorithm (CARA), which\ndynamically assigns communication roles based on real-\ntime signal quality and link stability, significantly improving\nmission reliability and transmission efficiency [82].\nIn parallel, spatial awareness plays a crucial role in guid-\ning communication decisions, especially in tasks like cov-\nerage control or environmental monitoring. Agents that are\nsituated near task-relevant features\u2014such as event hotspots,\nboundaries of explored regions, or dynamic fields\u2014may be\ngiven higher priority for channel access. A representative\napproach is Where2comm [83], which uses spatial confi-\ndence maps to quantify regions of perceptual importance.\nAgents near uncertain or unobserved zones are prioritized in\nthe communication schedule, ensuring effective collaborative\nperception while significantly reducing data transmission\noverhead. This form of prioritization is particularly useful\nwhen dealing with redundant observations from densely clus-\ntered agents. Moreover, spatially-aware communication can\nbe implemented through proximity-triggered transmission\npolicies, where agents initiate communication only when\ncertain geometric thresholds are exceeded\u2014such as separa-\ntion from neighbors or movement into new regions. These\nthreshold-based mechanisms reduce unnecessary communi-\ncation within tightly clustered groups while still allowing for\nadaptive updates when an agent transitions into a previously\nuncovered area. Such techniques are widely used in multi-\nrobot exploration and coverage control tasks to balance\ncoordination fidelity and network load.\nTogether, role-based and spatially-aware communication\nstrategies provide scalable and efficient frameworks for mes-\nsage prioritization in large MASs. By allocating communica-\ntion resources to agents based on contextual relevance, either\nthrough task role or spatial significance, these approaches\nalign naturally with goal-oriented metrics, complementing\nmore formal information-theoretic scheduling strategies like\nV oI and CoIL.\n2) Attention-based message prioritization\nInspired by neural attention mechanisms, attention-based\ncommunication enables agents to selectively attend to the\nmost informative peers\u2014those whose data is likely to en-\nhance performance or reduce uncertainty. In the context ofgoal-oriented multi-agent reinforcement learning, attention\nscores are typically computed from features like task rele-\nvance, prediction error, or belief divergence.\nFor example, in Message-Aware Graph Attention Net-\nworks (MAGAT) [84], agents apply a key\u2013query mechanism\nto dynamically weight incoming messages based on their\nrelevance to cooperative path planning. Importantly, MAGAT\ndemonstrates significantly improved success rates under\ncommunication constraints compared to models with uni-\nform aggregation. Similarly, sparsity-promoting algorithms\nsuch as those described in [85] learn an adaptive communi-\ncation graph via attention, allowing agents to communicate\nonly with the neighbors that matter most and resulting in\nenhanced scalability and efficiency.\nAnother foundational study [86], equips agents with a gat-\ning policy that determines on-the-fly whether and with whom\nto communicate. This gating is based on local observations\nand predicted impact on the shared task. By combining this\nwith message aggregation, the Attention-based Communi-\ncation (ATOC) can significantly reduce irrelevant traffic in\nsizable agent populations.\nThese methods support end-to-end learning of commu-\nnication policies in which attention weights are optimized\njointly with task execution strategies. The result is sparse,\ndynamic, and task-sensitive message routing, delivering both\ncommunication efficiency and high coordination quality.\nC. Graph-based approaches\nIn MASs, agents often need to coordinate decisions based\non partial observations and limited communication band-\nwidth. To address this challenge, graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and message passing algorithms have emerged as\nfoundational tools for learning structured representations\nand policies over dynamic agent networks. These methods\nmodel agents as nodes in a graph and their communication\nlinks as edges, allowing information to be exchanged via\niterative message aggregation from local neighborhoods. The\naggregation functions may be learned end-to-end or defined\nheuristically, and are often conditioned on edge features\nsuch as spatial proximity, sensing overlap, trust metrics, or\nsemantic relevance.\nRecent research has begun to integrate goal-oriented met-\nrics into graph-based message-passing frameworks. These\nmethods enable agents to dynamically reshape the commu-\nnication graph to prioritize task-relevant links and optimize\ncoordination under resource constraints. For example, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained popularity\nfor learning communication policies in decentralized multi-\nagent systems. Standard GNN architectures often employ\nbasic message aggregation schemes, which limit the agents\u2019\nability to distinguish and prioritize task-relevant informa-\ntion. Such limitations ultimately affect the performance of\nsolutions found and the overall resilience of the MAS. New\ntrends of research focus on communication-aware techniques\nVOLUME , 19\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nthat enable agents to dynamically adapt the communication\ntopology according to task requirements.\n1) Graph-Based Message Passing\nDobbe et al. [87] presents an information-theoretic frame-\nwork based on rate-distortion theory for fully decentralized\npolicies in multi-agent systems. They treat decentralization\nas a compression problem and use classical rate-distortion\nresults to analyze performance limits of distributed com-\nmunication. More specifically, the authors formulate the\ndesign of fully decentralized control policies as a distributed\nrate\u2013distortion problem. Let u\u2217\nidenote agent i\u2019s optimal\naction in the centralized solution to the following problem.\nProblem 6:\nmin\nufo(x, u)\ns.t.g(x, u) = 0 ,\nh(x, u)\u22640,\nwhere x= (x1, . . . , x N)is the global state and only a subset\nof agents i\u2208 Ccontrol components ui.\nIn the decentralized setting, each agent observes only its\nlocal state xiand implements a learned policy\n\u02c6ui= \u02c6\u03c0i(xi), (90)\nwhich approximates u\u2217\nibut incurs distortion\nd\u0000\n\u02c6ui, u\u2217\ni\u0001\n=\n\n\u02c6ui\u2212u\u2217\ni\n\n2. (91)\nBy interpreting the local policy as a compression of the full\nstatexinto the single observation xi, the expected distortion\nadmits a lower bound via rate\u2013distortion theory. Specifically,\nfor each agent ione considers the optimization\nD\u2217\ni= min\np(\u02c6ui|u\u2217\ni)E\u0002\nd(\u02c6ui, u\u2217\ni)\u0003\ns.t.I\u0000\n\u02c6ui;u\u2217\ni\u0001\n\u2264I\u0000\nxi;u\u2217\ni\u0001\n, (92)\nwhere I(\u00b7;\u00b7)denotes the mutual information. The constraint\nfollows from the data processing inequality, since \u02c6uidepends\nonu\u2217\nionly through xi. Classical rate\u2013distortion theory then\nimplies that the optimal distortion D\u2217\nidecreases monotoni-\ncally as the mutual information I(xi;u\u2217\ni)increases, yielding\na fundamental performance limit for any regression-based\npolicy. The same framework naturally extends to limited\ncommunication among agents. If agent imay also observe up\ntokadditional local states {xj:j\u2208S}, then one maximizes\nSi= arg max\nS\u2286N\\{ i},|S|=kI\u0000\nu\u2217\ni;xi,{xj:j\u2208S}\u0001\n,(93)\nin order to minimize the corresponding rate\u2013distortion lower\nbound. In the jointly Gaussian, mean-squared error case, this\nselection criterion admits a closed-form solution based on\nsquared correlations, and the resulting decentralized policies\nclosely approach the centralized optimum.Another particularly notable example in this domain is\nMulti-Agent Graph Attention Transformer (MAGAT) [84],\nwhich integrates attention-based GNNs with robotic path\nplanning. In MAGAT, each agent constructs its local obser-\nvation graph and learns to selectively attend to neighboring\nagents based on task-relevant features. The model employs\na key-query attention mechanism, where the importance of\neach neighbor is computed through the similarity between\na query vector (representing the agent\u2019s internal state or\ngoal) and key vectors (representing neighbors\u2019 encoded\nmessages). This attention-weighted message passing scheme\nallows agents to dynamically focus their communication on\nthe most informative peers, thereby reducing redundancy and\nenhancing coordination. MAGAT is trained end-to-end to\njointly learn both the communication policy (who to attend\nto) and the control policy (how to act), optimizing for global\ntask performance in scenarios such as cooperative navigation\nand obstacle avoidance. One of its key advantages is the\nability to adaptively reshape the communication topology in\nresponse to the environment and team dynamics, enabling\nrobust scalability in heterogeneous or partially connected\nsystems. Furthermore, the use of attention mechanisms\nallows for interpretable communication flows, which can\nreveal the emergent structure of decentralized collaboration\nin MASs. The success of MAGAT demonstrates the potential\nof GNN-based architectures not only to serve as function\napproximators for distributed control but also to encode flex-\nible, goal-oriented communication strategies that generalize\nacross tasks and team configurations.\n2) Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB)\nIn many real-world scenarios, including distributed sens-\ning, swarm robotics, and cooperative control, agents must\nextract, share, and utilize information that is not only relevant\nto their own goals but also influenced by their neighbors.\nClassical IB does not account for such relational depen-\ndencies. The Graph IB (GIB) [88] extends the classical IB\nprinciple to data structured as graphs. While the original IB\nmethod focuses on learning compressed representations Tof\nan input Xthat preserve relevant information about a target\nvariable Y, GIB seeks to perform this compression in the\ncontext of nodes embedded within a graph topology . This\nextension is particularly powerful for learning structured\nrepresentations in MASs, where each agent corresponds\nto a node in a communication graph, and interactions are\nencoded via edges. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios\nwhere agents must maintain a shared understanding of the\nenvironment (e.g., distributed SLAM, coverage control, or\njoint planning) without overwhelming the network.\nLetG= (V,E)denote a graph with node set V, edge\nsetE, and node features {Xv}v\u2208V. The objective is to learn\nnode-level representations {Tv}such that each Tvretains\ninformation relevant to a task variable Yv(e.g., a class label,\npolicy action, or control input), the representation is compact\nwith respect to the input Xvand its neighborhood N(v),\n20 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nand the learned representation incorporates and respects the\ngraph structure. This leads to a localized bottleneck objective\nof the form:\nLGIB=X\nv\u2208V\u0002\nI(Tv;XN(v))\u2212\u03b2I(Tv;Yv)\u0003\n, (94)\nwhere XN(v)denotes the features of node v\u2208 V and its\nneighbors, and \u03b2is a trade-off parameter.\nIn practice, the GIB framework is implemented using\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). The encoder network\np\u03d5(Tv|XN(v))maps node features to latent embeddings\nthrough message passing and neighborhood aggregation:\nTv=GNN \u03d5(Xv,{Xu:u\u2208 N(v)}), (95)\nwhile the decoder q\u03c8(Yv|Tv)predicts the downstream vari-\nableYv. To approximate the mutual information terms, varia-\ntional upper and lower bounds are employed, typically using\ntechniques from the VIB [47] and Deep Graph Infomax [89].\nGIB thus provides a theoretically grounded and practically\nscalable framework for task-aware communication and rep-\nresentation learning over structured multi-agent networks.\nV. Learning-based approaches to goal-oriented\ncommunications for MASs\nIn this section, the integration of learning-based methods\nwith goal-oriented semantic communication concepts will be\ninvestigated. Already it is shown in some works that the joint\ndesign (semantic content selection together with intelligent\nscheduling) can dramatically improve control accuracy. For\nexample, Wu et al. [90] introduced a goal-oriented semantic\ncommunication framework for remote robot control. In their\nUA V example, the controller is learned by deep reinforce-\nment learning (DRL) to send only commands that directly\naffect the task outcome. The UA V receiver uses an AoI/V oI\npolicy to queue messages: more urgent semantic packets\noverride stale ones. In simulations, their framework reduced\ntrajectory tracking error by approximately 91.5% compared\nto naive periodic control, showing the power of sending only\nthe right information at the right time to achieve goals.\nLearning-based communication strategies have emerged as\npowerful tools for enabling agents in MASs to adaptively\ndetermine what ,when , and with whom to communicate. Un-\nlike classical methods that rely on predefined communication\nprotocols or centralized control, these approaches empower\nagents to autonomously discover efficient communication\npolicies that are tightly coupled with task performance.\nThrough experience and task-driven feedback, agents can\nlearn to exchange only those messages that are necessary for\nachieving collective goals. This section provides an overview\nof key developments in learning-based goal-oriented commu-\nnication, with emphasis on MARL, attention-based sparsity\nmechanisms, and semantic representation learning.\nA. Communication learning via MARL\nMARL has emerged as a cornerstone framework for\ndeveloping learning-based communication strategies inMASs [91]\u2013[94]. In MARL, agents are trained to optimize\nlong-term cumulative rewards that depend not only on their\nown actions, but also on the actions and messages of other\nagents in the system. This provides a natural mechanism for\nagents to jointly learn communication and control policies,\nparticularly under decentralized or partially observable set-\ntings.\nAgents can be endowed with explicit communication\nchannels, enabling them to send discrete or continuous\nmessages to other agents. These messages can be jointly\noptimized along with control actions using gradient-based\nmethods, often through centralized training with decentral-\nized execution (CTDE) [95]. Architectures such as Comm-\nNet and DIAL2have demonstrated that differentiable com-\nmunication modules can facilitate the emergence of effi-\ncient, interpretable communication patterns. More recent\nwork explores message gating, dropout, or hard attention to\nfurther constrain and refine message exchange during policy\nlearning. These techniques help to reduce communication\noverhead by ensuring that only messages that improve team-\nlevel performance are transmitted.\nMoreover, the integration of the IB principle into MARL\nhas led to further innovations in compact and purposeful\ncommunication [47]. By regularizing the mutual information\nbetween the agent\u2019s observation and its outgoing message,\nagents are encouraged to compress their messages to include\nonly task-relevant content. This not only improves gener-\nalization but also aligns naturally with semantic encoder-\ndecoder architectures commonly used in cooperative MASs.\nWang et al. [96] developed Informative Multi-Agent Com-\nmunication (IMAC) using information bottleneck principles\nto learn efficient communication protocols under bandwidth\nconstraints. They prove that limited bandwidth requires low-\nentropy messages and use information theory to optimize\nmessage scheduling.\nReal-world applications, such as wireless multi-UA V\nnetworks, illustrate the utility of these approaches un-\nder communication-constrained and dynamic settings [97].\nAgents in such domains learn to weigh communication costs\nagainst potential improvements in navigation, mapping, or\ncoverage, achieving robust coordination despite limited and\nnoisy channels. These demonstrations highlight the potential\nof MARL to enable adaptive, self-organizing communication\nbehavior in large-scale and realistic MAS deployments.\nB. Sparsity and Attention Mechanisms\nIn MASs, where agents operate in bandwidth-limited\nor latency-sensitive environments, communication efficiency\n2CommNet and DIAL are architectures for multi-agent communication\nand learning, particularly in the context of deep reinforcement learning.\nCommNet, or Communication Network, allows agents to communicate with\neach other by sharing a single, learned communication vector. DIAL, or\nDeepInfluence Architecture, is a more complex architecture where agents\ncan influence each other\u2019s policies through a dedicated communication\nchannel.\nVOLUME , 21\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nbecomes essential. Learning-based approaches have increas-\ningly focused on strategies that induce sparsity and selec-\ntivity in inter-agent communication, often guided by learned\nattention mechanisms.\nAttention mechanisms, originally popularized in natural\nlanguage processing, have proven to be powerful tools for\nprioritizing information flow among agents [86], [98], [99].\nIn the context of MASs, attention allows each agent to\ndynamically evaluate the relevance of messages from its\nneighbors. Agents learn to assign attention weights based\non spatial proximity, uncertainty, prediction divergence, or\nshared task context. As a result, attention mechanisms enable\nselective aggregation of messages, ensuring that only the\nmost informative inputs are integrated into decision-making\nprocesses.\nTo promote sparsity [100], various regularization tech-\nniques have been introduced [101]. These include L1\npenalties on communication magnitudes, entropy-based con-\nstraints that limit the spread of attention weights [102],\nand explicit communication budgets that cap the number\nof messages an agent can send or receive. By treating\ncommunication as a costly action, these mechanisms incen-\ntivize agents to develop parsimonious messaging strategies,\ntransmitting only when the expected task benefit outweighs\nthe cost.\nOverall, the combination of sparsity and attention mecha-\nnisms enables scalable communication in MASs by filtering\nunnecessary exchanges and focusing inter-agent dialogue on\ntask-critical content. This results in systems that are not only\nmore efficient but also more robust to communication failure,\ninterference, and delays.\nC. Semantic Representation Learning for Message Gen-\neration\nLearning what to communicate is as important as learning\nwhen and to whom. Semantic representation learning focuses\non developing communication strategies where agents gen-\nerate messages that are not raw data, but compressed repre-\nsentations optimized for downstream utility. These represen-\ntations encode latent variables, such as beliefs, predictions,\nor summaries of local observations, that are directly relevant\nto the shared task.\nEnd-to-end architectures, often inspired by encoder-\ndecoder models, are commonly used for semantic communi-\ncation learning. Here, the encoder maps the agent\u2019s observa-\ntion into a compact latent message, while the decoder uses\nthis message to guide decision-making. The parameters of\nboth encoder and decoder are trained jointly, using gradients\nfrom a shared objective, such as classification accuracy,\ncontrol performance, or accumulated task reward.\nOne major advantage of semantic communication is that\nit enables abstraction. By discarding task-irrelevant details,\nagents can generalize their communication behavior across\ndifferent scenarios or environments. For instance, instead of\ntransmitting full state vectors, agents may learn to share pre-dictions about other agents\u2019 intent, likelihood of collisions,\nor the presence of strategic opportunities, information that is\nmore useful for coordination than raw sensor data.\nRecent works further refine this paradigm by integrating\nsemantic loss functions into the learning process. These\ninclude task-specific metrics such as classification margin,\ntrajectory divergence, or goal achievement rates. By explic-\nitly linking message quality to task outcome, agents learn to\nencode the most relevant aspects of their observations in a\ncompact and efficient manner.\nD. Outlook of learning-based goal-oriented communica-\ntion for MASs\nLearning-based goal-oriented communication is poised to\ntransform how MASs coordinate and reason in complex,\ndistributed settings. These methods offer scalable, decentral-\nized, and adaptive mechanisms for enabling communication\nprotocols that are aligned with both environmental dynamics\nand task objectives. The ability of agents to learn when, what,\nand how to communicate through interaction and feedback\nallows MASs to move beyond rigid, handcrafted protocols\ntoward flexible and robust cooperation.\nDespite significant progress, several challenges remain.\nInterpreting the emergent communication policies is often\ndifficult, making it hard to verify safety or correctness.\nMoreover, the learned protocols may be brittle under non-\nstationary conditions, such as changing team composition or\nadversarial interference. Finally, while current methods are\nlargely empirical, stronger theoretical foundations are needed\nto ensure that the developed approaches will work across a\nwide range of tasks and network topologies.\nVI. Application of Goal-Oriented Communication in\nReal-World Systems\nA. Semantic networks for cooperative autonomous vehi-\ncles.\nThe Internet of Vehicles (IoV) connects cars, infrastruc-\nture, and users to support intelligent transportation. However,\nmodern IoV applications (e.g. autonomous driving, traffic\nmanagement, vehicle surveillance) generate massive amounts\nof data that must be sent to servers under strict latency\nconstraints [103]. Traditional radio networks are already\npushed to their Shannon limits, so the IoV\u2019s spectrum re-\nsources are quickly becoming inadequate. In addition, nearby\nvehicles often sense correlated or overlapping information\n(e.g. multiple cameras see the same scene), so naively send-\ning all raw data wastes bandwidth. The redundancy among\nthe transmitted data dramatically deteriorates the spectrum\nefficiency and irrelevant content can cause severe network\ncongestion. As a consequence, IoV faces an exploding data\nload and spectrum scarcity that conventional (symbol-level)\ncommunications cannot efficiently handle [104].\nTo address these challenges, Xu et al. [105] propose shift-\ning focus from bits to task-relevant semantics, i.e., instead\nof insisting on delivering every source symbol perfectly,\n22 VOLUME ,\n",
