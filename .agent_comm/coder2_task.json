For example, if multiple vehicles\ncapture images of the same car, they need only send semantic\nfeatures (like an ID or key descriptors) rather than the\nfull raw images. This semantic-aware approach promises to\ndrastically cut down the transmitted data, alleviating IoV\nspectrum bottlenecks and congestion. To implement this\nvision, the paper proposes a Cooperative Semantic Com-\nmunication (Co-SC) framework for multi-vehicle IoV . The\ncore idea is that multiple nearby vehicles jointly encode\ntheir sensed data into shared semantic information. The\narchitecture involves the following key components:\n\u2022Semantic encoders (at vehicles): Each vehicle (user) pro-\ncesses its raw data through a semantic encoder, which\nextracts a high-dimensional semantic feature that captures\nthe task-relevant meaning of the data (e.g. object identity,\nscene description).\n\u2022Joint Source-Channel (JSC) encoders (at vehicles): The\nsemantic features are then passed through a deep JSC\nencoder that maps them into channel symbols. Unlike\nconventional channel coding, this JSC encoding is se-\nmantically aware. Additionally, it learns to protect more\nimportant features by allocating more symbols, and it is\ntrained jointly with the semantic encoder.\n\u2022Shared channel transmission: Vehicles share a common\nwireless channel (e.g., uplink to a roadside server) to\nsend their semantic symbols. Since the semantic encoder\nhas removed overlap, the data from different cars is more\ncompact.\n\u2022Cooperative JSC decoder (at server): At the server or\nedge host, a cooperative JSC decoder jointly processes the\nreceived symbols from all vehicles. Because the vehicles\u2019\ndata is correlated, this decoder can use one user\u2019s symbols\nto help decode another\u2019s, narrowing the uncertainty space\nand correcting errors.\n\u2022Semantic decoder and task modules (at server): The\nrecovered semantic features are then fed into a semantic\ndecoder or directly into task-specific modules. In the\npaper\u2019s example (an image-based ID retrieval task), the\nserver uses the combined semantic features to identify\nvehicles in a database. The framework can also simply\nfeed semantic features to deep learning models for tasks\nlike detection or localization.\nThe proposed framework, Co-SC, is a novel multiuser coop-\nerative architecture. It integrates semantic encoders/decoders\nand joint source-channel coding for each vehicle, plus a\nshared knowledge base, so that multiple vehicles\u2019 data is\ncompressed and decoded jointly. By jointly designing the\nsemantic encoders and decoders across users, the system\nlearns shared representations: shared (common) semantics\nand distinct (unique) semantics are separated. The coopera-\ntive decoders exploit these correlations to compress redun-\ndancies and improve decoding.\nEldeeb et al. [106] developed a multi-task semantic\ncommunication framework among connected autonomousvehicles (CA Vs). They focus on sharing traffic sign informa-\ntion: one vehicle\u2019s camera captures a sign, a convolutional\nautoencoder extracts its semantic features, and the compact\nencoding is sent to other CA Vs over a network. At the\nreceiver, one decoder reconstructs the image (for visualiza-\ntion) and another classifies the sign. In simulations (e.g.,\nin foggy conditions), this task-oriented scheme outperforms\nconventional approaches in terms of classification accuracy\nand image similarity while using fewer bits. In other words,\nCA Vs share only goal-relevant semantic data (the label of\nthe sign), enhancing bandwidth efficiency without sacrificing\nsafety-critical understanding.\nThe multiuser cooperative designs [105], [106] highlight\nhow cooperation in MASs is key. Enabling cooperative,\nsemantic-rich transmissions could transform IoV from clas-\nsic bit-pipes into smart, goal-oriented networks for next-\ngeneration transportation.\nB. Distributed SLAM with goal-oriented communication\nDistributed Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM) is fundamental to the deployment of multi-robot\nsystems in real-world environments. However, traditional\nmulti-robot SLAM architectures face significant challenges\nrelated to communication bandwidth and computation costs.\nIn many systems, robots either exchange large, detailed sen-\nsor data, like full 3D point clouds or complete maps, at high\nfrequencies, which is costly and redundant, or avoid sharing\naltogether, leading to degraded localization and inconsistent\nmaps [107].\nOne promising approach in distributed SLAM is to reduce\nthe size and frequency of the data that robots share, by\ntransmitting only the most useful and compact information.\nThat is, robots can share compressed and relevant summaries\nof what they observe. These summaries are often called\nlightweight feature descriptors , and they capture the most\nrelevant geometric or semantic features of the environment,\nsuch as corners, edges, or recognizable objects. For example,\nthe DCL-SLAM framework [108] uses specialized descrip-\ntors built from LiDAR data that allow each robot to detect\nwhether it has visited a place before\u2014or whether another\nrobot has\u2014without needing to share the full scan. This saves\nsignificant bandwidth while still supporting accurate local-\nization and map merging. Another efficient method involves\ndividing a robot\u2019s map into smaller, more manageable pieces\ncalled 2.5D submaps. These represent the local environment\nusing height information, like a terrain map. Robots can align\nand compare these submaps with those from their teammates\nto determine how their positions relate. When a match is\nfound (called a loop closure), the robots can update their\nmaps accordingly. These updates are often performed using\na sliding window approach, meaning the robot focuses on\nrecent or relevant data only, which reduces computational\ncost while keeping the map consistent [109]. Studies have\nshown that this selective communication strategy can reduce\ndata exchange volume by approximately 30% while still\nVOLUME , 23\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nmaintaining global map consistency and accurate localiza-\ntion [109].\nAnother line of work focuses on robust loop closure de-\ntection and prioritization. For example, DOOR-SLAM [110]\nintroduces distributed pairwise consistency maximization to\nallow less conservative place-recognition thresholds, yielding\nmore valid inter-robot matches without exchanging raw\ndata. Using less stringent front-end thresholds while filtering\noutliers downstream improves both map accuracy and loop\nclosure yield under constrained bandwidths. In [111], key\nmatches are selected based on pose graph structure, proxim-\nity, and point-cloud features for loop closure prioritization\nfor large-scale multi-robot exploration, reducing computa-\ntional load by roughly 50\u201375% while improving mapping\naccuracy.\nOne prominent system demonstrating this approach is\nKimera-Multi [112], a fully distributed SLAM framework\nthat allows multiple robots to collaboratively build both ge-\nometric and semantic maps. Kimera-Multi operates through\npeer-to-peer communication, meaning robots connect di-\nrectly without relying on a central server. It integrates robust\nplace recognition andpose-graph optimization , which aligns\nthe relative positions of robots and observed landmarks.\nThese capabilities enable the system to build globally con-\nsistent, annotated 3D mesh maps in real-time while keeping\ncommunication minimal. The result is an efficient and scal-\nable system that supports real-world deployment scenarios,\nsuch as exploration, search and rescue, and infrastructure\ninspection, even under tight bandwidth constraints.\nCollaborative SLAM has been effectively adapted for use\nin teams of UA Vs, allowing them to map and navigate large\nenvironments together [113]\u2013[115]. One practical approach\ninvolves equipping each UA V with a monocular camera\nand short-range wireless ranging devices. When two UA Vs\ncome close to one another, they can combine their views to\nform a temporary stereo vision setup. This setup allows the\nteam to better estimate distances and improve the accuracy\nof the map, especially in challenging environments where\nscale is hard to determine from a single camera alone.\nImportantly, this collaboration is done in a distributed way,\nin which each UA V processes its own data locally and\nonly shares essential information with its neighboring UA Vs.\nThis keeps communication fast and efficient, with minimal\ndelay, making the system well-suited for real-time tasks like\nexploration, inspection, or search and rescue. By working\ntogether in this manner, UA Vs can build more accurate\nand consistent maps while avoiding the need to send large\namounts of raw sensor data over the network.\nOverall, these innovations represent a shift toward more\ngoal-oriented communication in multi-robot mapping. These\nstrategies help robots collaborate in real-time while im-\nprove both efficiency and robustness in dynamic, bandwidth-\nlimited environments. By sharing only what\u2019s needed, when\nit\u2019s needed, they embody the principles of goal-oriented\ncommunication in SLAM. Experimental benchmarks acrossdiverse environments (e.g. subterranean, outdoor exploration,\nGPS-denied settings) consistently show that such task-driven\nschemes outperform dense or static communication ap-\nproaches in both map accuracy and bandwidth efficiency.\nLooking forward, embedding explicit goal-awareness into\nSLAM communication policies will be critical, including\nlearning to predict when a loop closure will significantly\nreduce global uncertainty, compressing semantics (e.g., ob-\nject landmarks, semantic segmentation maps) rather than raw\ngeometry, and designing adaptive coordination strategies that\nbalance exploration versus sharing, especially in heteroge-\nneous agent teams or dynamic environments. Such directions\nalign with the broader vision of goal-driven communication:\nagents communicate not just to share data, but to support\nshared objectives with minimal cost.\nC. Federated Learning and Edge Intelligence\nAnother important domain where goal-oriented communi-\ncation can be a key enabler are AI/ML services, relying on\nfederated learning (FL) and edge intelligence. Here, resource\nand communication efficiency are pivotal and unfortunately,\ntraditional paradigms usually rely on message exchanges\nthat do not consider if the transmitted data effectively\ncontributes to the global learning goal. As a remedy, goal-\noriented communication can address redundant transmis-\nsions by activating devices only when their information\nadvances the global learning objective. Considering that edge\nenvironments are characterized by heterogeneous resource\navailability and dynamic network conditions, the benefits of\ngoal-oriented communication have been presented in various\nrecent works.\nThe paper by Pandey et al. [116] introduces a risk-aware\nparticipation strategy for FL, treating device selection as a\ndistributed goal-oriented communication problem. In greater\ndetail, devices independently evaluate whether participating\nin a particular training round will benefit the global model\nwhile considering their local costs and the value of their\ncontributions. To support this process, a parameter server is\nused, providing semantic feedback to each device, facilitating\nthem to calculate the utility of its update and in case\nthe marginal benefit is insufficient it will remain silent.\nThis process results in significant reduction of unnecessary\ntransmissions, while avoiding the propagation of low-quality\nupdates. Performance evaluation demonstrates that integrat-\ning risk-awareness and semantic feedback into the partic-\nipation decisions, a 1.4\u00d7improvement in communication\nefficiency over baseline FL alternatives is achieved, without\ndegrading model accuracy. A relevant use case for this\nstrategy can be smart healthcare systems, where mobile and\nwearable devices must optimize power usage, data privacy,\nand relevance to the global model before contributing to\ncollaborative diagnostics.\nThen, Costafreda and Elayoubi [117] proposes a hybrid\noptimization approach, adopting goal-oriented communica-\ntion in the scheduling and resource allocation of FL in\n24 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 25 ---\nGoal-oriented\ncommunication edge intelligenceFIGURE 4. A unified scenario illustrating goal-oriented communication in MASs: autonomous ground vehicles, cyclists, and aerial drones\ncollaboratively operate in a smart city environment. Agents share semantically relevant, goal-oriented information for coordinated navigation,\nsurveillance, and human interaction, demonstrating key application domains such as distributed perception, edge intelligence, and safety-critical\ncoordination under bandwidth constraints.\nmobile networks. More specifically, the authors formulate\na policy selection problem to optimize the device sampling\nprobabilities to balance resource usage and data utility, in\nterms of the processing capacity of each device and the qual-\nity of its data. In this setting, a hybrid genetic algorithm is\npresented, dynamically adapting the transmission strategies\nto prioritize clients whose updates maximize model accuracy\nunder radio resource constraints. Contrary to traditional FL,\nwhere all available clients might contribute equally, this hy-\nbrid approach ensures that only clients with high data utility\nand low transmission cost will participate. This strategy leads\nto a communication-efficient FL process, achieving higher\nperformance with a reduced number of updates. A relevant\narea where this method can be employed involves vehicular\nnetworks, where edge devices in cars must appropriately\nschedule their participation in federated perception models,\nadhering to strict latency and bandwidth constraints.\nFurthermore, Wei et al. in [118] develop a novel federated\nsemantic learning (FedSem) architecture, considering the IB\nprinciple into a multi-user semantic communication setting\nfor FL. Their system focuses on transmitting compressed\nbut semantically rich representations to construct semantic\nknowledge graphs from raw images, allowing for efficient\nand task-specific learning. Here, instead of treating all se-\nmantic features equally, the information bottleneck principle\nfilters out non-essential content, only keeping task-relevant\nsemantics for the inference objective. The proposed feder-\nated training process jointly updates device-side semantic\nencoders and a base station-side decoder. Results indicateimportant gains in rate-distortion efficiency and faster con-\nvergence under dynamic channel conditions. Architectures,\nsuch as FedSem can be well-suited to applications related\nto collaborative aerial surveillance with drones, where only\nmission-critical semantic features, such as detected threats\nor anomalies must be communicated to improve resource\nefficiency of the learning task.\nThen, Wei et al. [119] focuses on combining goal-oriented\ncommunication with FL, developing a resource allocation\nframework tailored to CPS. Their solutions departs from\nconventional throughput-maximization, maximizing instead\nthe information utility gain, i.e. the marginal improvement in\nCPS task objectives stemming from data transmission. Thus,\nthey model FL as a CPS task, where devices are selectively\nprovided communication resources, based on how their data\ncontributes to system-level goals. The resource allocation\nproblem is formulated as a knapsack problem and solved via\na divide-and-conquer greedy algorithm. Simulations high-\nlight that optimizing for task-related information over data\nthroughput offers high efficiency gains in FL performance.\nThis approach can be applied to IIoT deployments, such\nas predictive maintenance in manufacturing plants, where\nsensors must prioritize energy-efficient transmissions that\nimprove the accuracy fault prediction models.\nBelow we discuss two works that consider semantics-\naware metrics in FL. More specifically, the work in [120]\nproposes a scheduling policy that combines Age of Update\n(AoU) concepts and the data Shapley metric. This policy\nconsiders the freshness and value of received parameter\nVOLUME , 25\n\n--- Page 26 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nupdates from individual data sources and real-time channel\nconditions to enhance the operational efficiency of FL.\nFurthermore, the work in [121] introduces the concept of\nVersion Age of Information (V AoI) to FL. Unlike traditional\nAoI metrics, V AoI considers both timeliness and content\nstaleness. Each client\u2019s version age is updated discretely,\nindicating the freshness of information. V AoI is incorporated\ninto the client scheduling policy to minimize the average\nV AoI, mitigating the impact of outdated local updates and\nenhancing the stability of FL systems.\nVII. Open Challenges and Future Directions\nA. Unifying Information-Theoretic and Learning-Based\nApproaches\nA key open challenge in goal-oriented communication for\nMASs lies in bridging the gap between information-theoretic\nformulations andlearning-based communication strategies .\nClassical information theory provides a rigorous framework\nfor quantifying data relevance and efficiency using tools such\nas mutual information, rate-distortion theory, and channel\ncapacity [22], [23]. More recent extensions, including goal-\noriented rate-distortion [52], [53], [122] and semantic com-\nmunication models [48] aim to describe information sources\nthat have semantic aspects and proposed corresponding\nrate distortion problem formulations for characterizing the\namount of information content of such semantic sources.\nHowever, these methods often assume known models and\ndistributions, which are rarely available in large-scale, real-\nworld MASs. In contrast, learning-based approaches, es-\npecially those rooted in DRL and MARL, offer flexible\nmechanisms for discovering communication policies through\nlearning. Agents can learn to determine what, when, and with\nwhom to communicate by optimizing task-level objectives\ndirectly, often using attention mechanisms or graph-based\nmessage passing (see relevant discussion is Section B).\nDespite notable advancements, a gap remains between\ninformation-theoretic and learning-based approaches to com-\nmunication. Learning methods provide flexible, data-driven\nmechanisms for discovering effective communication strate-\ngies, yet they often offer no formal guarantees of optimality.\nIn contrast, information-theoretic models yield frameworks\nfor quantifying relevance and efficiency, but they typically\nrely on idealized assumptions and do not readily adapt to\ncomplex task-driven settings. Bridging this gap calls for\nthe development of hybrid approaches that embed theo-\nretical structure into learning-based models. For example,\none strategy is to incorporate information relevance (formu-\nlated through rate-distortion or utility-based criteria) into the\nlearning objectives of communication systems. By treating\ncommunication as a constrained optimization problem over\nboth message content and utility, it becomes possible to\ndesign learning systems that are not only effective but\nalso grounded in formal principles of informational value.\nUltimately, the overarching objective is to design learning-\nbased communication systems that are not only empiricallyeffective but also theoretically grounded. These systems\nshould be capable of learning what to communicate, when,\nand to whom according to a goal (individual or joint).\nAchieving this vision necessitates a deeper integration of\ninformation significance metrics with modern machine learn-\ning paradigms.\nAdditionally, learning-to-communicate frameworks will\nneed to be extended to support compositional reasoning,\nsemantic abstraction, and causal inference to ensure gener-\nalization and interpretability (see discussion in Section C).\nAs multi-agent deployments become increasingly prevalent\nin real-world domains, ranging from autonomous vehicles\nto environmental monitoring and disaster response, learning-\nbased goal-oriented communication will be a key enabler of\nefficient, scalable, and intelligent collective behavior.\nB. Scalability in Large Multi-Agent Systems\nAs the number of agents in a MAS increases, commu-\nnication, coordination, and learning become significantly\nmore complex. Scalability is a critical challenge for goal-\noriented communication, particularly in systems involving\ndense, heterogeneous, or spatially distributed agents. In\nsuch settings, naive communication strategies, such as all-\nto-all broadcasting or uniform message passing, become\nimpractical due to excessive bandwidth usage, latency, and\nprocessing overhead.\nTo enable efficient coordination at scale, communica-\ntion must become increasingly selective, structured, and\ndecentralized. One promising direction involves exploiting\ntopological sparsity through graph-based message passing\nframeworks, where agents only communicate with a sub-\nset of their neighbors based on learned attention weights,\nproximity, or role-based criteria. These approaches allow\nfor adaptive communication graphs that evolve in response\nto task demands and environmental dynamics, significantly\nreducing communication overhead without sacrificing perfor-\nmance. Another key aspect of scalability is the emergence\nofhierarchical architectures , where agents are organized\ninto clusters or roles (e.g., leaders, followers, relays), and\nintra-cluster and inter-cluster communication are treated\ndifferently. This enables localized decision-making while\nmaintaining global coordination, and aligns naturally with\ngoal-oriented communication models. In addition, multi-\nresolution orcompressed representation learning approaches\noffer further scalability benefits by enabling agents to ex-\nchange task-specific features rather than raw state observa-\ntions. Such techniques are particularly useful when combined\nwith importance-aware scheduling, where agents selectively\ntransmit only high-value information according to metrics\nsuch as CoIL, V oI or AoI (see discussion in Section IV).\nAchieving scalable goal-oriented communication requires\nthe joint design of communication protocols, learning algo-\nrithms, and network architectures. This includes developing\nsparsity-aware learning objectives, integrating hierarchical\ncoordination schemes, and leveraging the structure of real-\n26 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nworld environments to reduce the effective communication\ncomplexity. As the size and diversity of MASs continue to\ngrow, the ability to scale communication in a goal-relevant\nmanner will be essential for enabling efficient, robust, and\ninterpretable collective intelligence.\nC. Safety, Reliability, and Interpretability of Emergent\nProtocols\nAs communication protocols in multi-agent systems be-\ncome increasingly learned and emergent, questions of safety,\nreliability, and interpretability take on critical importance.\nWhile learning-based communication policies enable adap-\ntivity and task-awareness, they also introduce unpredictabil-\nity and potential fragility, especially in safety-critical appli-\ncations such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, or\ncollaborative robotics. In such contexts, agents must ensure\nthat their messaging strategies do not inadvertently degrade\nsystem safety or violate task constraints. For example, de-\ncisions about whether or not to transmit information can\ndirectly impact state estimation, control performance, and\nultimately, system stability. This calls for communication\nprotocols that are not only goal-oriented but also robust\nto uncertainties, resilient to adversarial perturbations, and\ntransparent in their behavior.\nA particularly important concern in safety-critical con-\ntrol is the guarantee of set invariance , i.e., ensuring that\nthe system\u2019s state remains within a predefined safe set\nover time. Various safety filters , such as those based on\ncontrol barrier functions or predictive filtering, have been\ndeveloped to detect and correct unsafe control inputs in a\nminimally invasive manner. However, these typically require\nsafety constraints to be explicitly defined in the state space,\nwhich limits their applicability to geometrically grounded\nconditions like collision avoidance. For agents operating\nin complex or human-centric environments, safety often\nextends beyond geometric constraints to encompass seman-\ntic, context-dependent rules, referred to as semantic safety\nconstraints [123]. Designing communication and control\nprotocols that respect such implicit constraints remains an\nopen challenge. It requires integrating high-level knowledge,\nreasoning, and shared intent into the communication loop.\nIn parallel, the interpretability of emergent protocols is\nessential for system verification, human\u2013robot collaboration,\nand transferability across tasks and domains. Understanding\nwhat information is communicated, why it is shared, and\nhow it affects collective decision-making is crucial for es-\ntablishing trust in autonomous multi-agent systems.\nUltimately, ensuring that learned communication policies\nremain safe, reliable, and interpretable requires combining\ndesign with adaptive learning. It calls for the develop-\nment of formal tools to analyze and constrain emergent\nbehaviors, along with empirical validation in realistic, high-\nstakes scenarios. As goal-oriented communication continues\nto evolve, these properties will be key enablers of real-world\ndeployment.D. Extensions of GIB\nGIB offers a foundation for designing communication\nprotocols in MASs. We discuss some promising possible\nresearch directions that can significantly expand the applica-\nbility and impact of GIB-based methods.\nFirst, extending GIB to temporal domains is a crucial\nstep toward supporting agents that operate in dynamic,\nsequential environments. Many MAS tasks, such as cooper-\native exploration, real-time traffic coordination, or adaptive\nmonitoring, demand communication protocols that take into\naccount the history of observations and interactions over\ntime. A temporal extension of GIB would allow agents to\nencode and transmit compressed yet informative summaries\nof their trajectories, decisions, and evolving internal states.\nThese models could be implemented via recurrent GNNs,\ngraph-attention mechanisms, or temporal message-passing\nframeworks, capturing dependencies not only across space\n(agents) but also across time. Furthermore, temporal GIB\ncould help mitigate memory bottlenecks and redundancy by\nfiltering out outdated or irrelevant historical data, focusing\ninstead on predictive and decision-critical features.\nSecond, the development of hierarchical GIB architectures\nholds promise for improving scalability and modularity in\nlarge-scale MASs. In many practical settings, agents are\nnaturally organized into subgroups, either by spatial prox-\nimity, function, or communication constraints. Hierarchical\nGIB models can support multi-level abstraction, where bot-\ntlenecks are enforced not only at the individual agent level\nbut also across clusters, regions, or roles. For example,\nintra-group communication could involve fine-grained, high-\nfrequency updates, while inter-group communication could\nbe based on coarse, abstract representations. This separation\nof concerns allows the system to scale gracefully and remain\nrobust under variable communication budgets or partial\nagent failure. Additionally, hierarchical models align well\nwith concepts in hierarchical reinforcement learning and\ndecentralized planning, enabling structured communication\nthat mirrors task hierarchies.\nThird, integrating GIB with tools from causal inference\ncan improve the interpretability, generalization, and relia-\nbility of learned communication policies. Traditional infor-\nmation bottleneck methods rely on statistical dependencies,\nwhich may not always correspond to causal influences on\ntask outcomes. By incorporating causal reasoning into the\nbottleneck objective, GIB can help agents to generalize\nacross different environments and task configurations, im-\nprove robustness to distribution shifts, and facilitate debug-\nging and verification of communication strategies.\nTogether, these extensions point toward a unified vision of\nGIB as a flexible and theoretically grounded framework for\ngoal-oriented, scalable, and interpretable communication in\ncomplex multi-agent environments. By integrating temporal\nmodeling, hierarchical structure, and causal reasoning, future\nGIB models can better accommodate the rich demands of\nreal-world MASs applications.\nVOLUME , 27\n\n--- Page 28 ---\nCharalambous et al. : Preparation of Papers for IEEE OPEN JOURNALS\nE. Cross-Domain Synergies\nWhile this overview has concentrated on goal-oriented\ncommunication within MASs, the concepts discussed here\nresonate strongly with several adjacent research areas. These\ndomains not only present new application frontiers but\nalso introduce complementary tools and challenges that can\nrefine and extend goal-oriented communication paradigms.\nIn particular, three cross-domain interfaces stand out as both\npromising and underexplored.\nFirst, multi-modal perception [124] integrates heteroge-\nneous sensory streams (namely, vision, language, audio,\ntactile feedback) into unified representations that capture\nricher context than any single modality alone. Embedding\ngoal-oriented communication within multi-modal pipelines\nenables agents to transmit distilled, semantically aligned\nsummaries rather than raw sensor data, thereby reducing\nbandwidth and processing requirements without sacrificing\ntask-critical content. For example, instead of streaming entire\nvideo frames, an autonomous vehicle could share compact\nsymbolic descriptors of relevant objects and their predicted\ntrajectories. The central challenge lies in developing multi-\nmodal semantic encoders and decoders whose distortion\nmeasures are explicitly tied to downstream task success,\nrather than modality-specific reconstruction fidelity.\nSecond, large-scale distributed AI [125], including fed-\nerated learning, distributed optimization, and cooperative\ninference, pushes communication constraints to the fore-\nfront. In such systems, agents often operate under stringent\nbandwidth, latency, and privacy requirements while jointly\noptimizing a shared model or decision policy. Integrat-\ning goal-oriented principles into federated decision-making\ncould allow agents to exchange only those gradients, feature\nembeddings, or variables that provide maximal utility for\nglobal performance. This opens new research challenges:\nquantifying the value of such updates via information-\ntheoretic or causal measures, designing adaptive commu-\nnication topologies that dynamically select optimal peer\ninteractions, and ensuring robustness under adversarial or\nnon-stationary conditions.\nThird, causal inference [126] offers a foundation for\ninterpretability and robustness in goal-oriented messaging.\nBy augmenting transmitted content with causal structure\n(e.g., explanations of why a message is relevant or how\nan observation affects task outcomes) agents can improve\ncoordination, detect misleading updates, and anticipate the\nimpact of actions in safety-critical settings. This is especially\nvaluable for human\u2013machine teaming, where trust hinges\non transparency and accountability. Open research directions\ninclude formalizing causal semantics within rate\u2013distortion\nand information bottleneck frameworks, incorporating them\ninto real-time communication protocols, and exploring how\ncausal annotations can enhance resilience to distribution\nshifts or deceptive behavior.\nBridging goal-oriented communication with these do-\nmains will require new theoretical models, joint learn-ing\u2013communication optimization strategies, and cross-\ndomain interfaces. Achieving this integration promises a\nnew class of cyber\u2013physical and AI systems capable of\nexchanging only the most task-relevant, interpretable, and\nsemantically rich information across sensing, computation,\nand control layers, thus minimizing overhead while maxi-\nmizing effectiveness, transparency, and safety.\nVIII. Concluding remarks\nGoal-oriented communication is emerging as a foundational\nparadigm in the design of intelligent and efficient multi-\nagent systems. By shifting the focus from transmitting data\nfor the sake of fidelity to communicating information that\nisrelevant for achieving shared objectives , this paradigm\nprovides a way to reduce bandwidth, improve coordina-\ntion, and enhance task performance in resource-constrained\nenvironments. This overview has outlined the theoretical\nframeworks, mentioning some real-world applications of\ngoal-oriented communications, offering a unified lens that\nbridges information theory and learning-based strategies in\nthe context of MASs. We have highlighted how classical\nmodels such as rate-distortion theory and mutual informa-\ntion serve as building blocks for more advanced constructs\nlike goal-oriented and SDR frameworks. These approaches\nprovide formal metrics to quantify the utility of infor-\nmation with respect to tasks, offering critical insights for\ncommunication scheduling and prioritization in multi-agent\nsettings. At the same time, learning-based techniques have\ndemonstrated the potential to discover efficient, decentralized\ncommunication policies directly from data. As multi-agent\nsystems grow in scale, complexity, and heterogeneity, the\nimportance of designing communication protocols that are\ntask-aware, adaptive, and scalable will continue to grow.\nWe have discussed the key strategies to meet these needs and\nemphasized the critical importance of safety, reliability, and\ninterpretability in learned communication protocols, espe-\ncially for real-world deployment in high-stakes domains such\nas autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial automation.\nDespite significant progress, numerous open challenges re-\nmain. The integration of information-theoretic structure into\nneural architectures, the design of benchmarks for evaluating\ngoal-oriented communication systems, and the development\nof robust methods for reasoning under semantic and temporal\nuncertainty are all fertile grounds for future research. There\nis also a pressing need for tools that can formally analyze and\nconstrain the behavior of emergent communication protocols\nto ensure safe and predictable operation.\nThe vision outlined in this paper is one where communi-\ncation in MASs becomes a purposeful, context-aware act,\ndriven not by the quantity of data, but by its value to\na collective goal. This overview can serve as a roadmap\nfor researchers and practitioners seeking to build the next\ngeneration of communication-aware multi-agent systems that\nare not only efficient, but also intelligent, robust, and aligned\nwith their operational objectives.\n28 VOLUME ,\n\n--- Page 29 ---\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
